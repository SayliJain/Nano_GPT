ELECTRIC CHARGES
AND FIELDS
1.1  I NTRODUCTION
All of us have the experience of seeing a spark or hearing a crackle when
we take of f our synthetic clothes or sweater , particularly in dry weather .
Have you ever tried to find any explanation for this phenomenon? Another
common example of electric discharge is the lightning that we see in the
sky during thunderstor ms. W e also experience a sensation of an electric
shock either while opening the door of a car or holding the iron bar of a
bus after sliding from our seat. The reason for these experiences is
discharge of electric charges through our body, which were accumulated
due to rubbing of insulating sur faces. Y ou might have also hear d that
this is due to generation of static electricity. This is precisely the topic we
are going to discuss in this and the next chapter . Static means anything
that does not move or change with time. Electrostatics deals with
the study of forces, fields and potentials arising from
static charges .
1.2  E LECTRIC  CHARGE
Historically the credit of discovery of the fact that amber rubbed with
wool or silk cloth attracts light objects goes to Thales of Miletus, Greece,
around 600 BC. The name electricity is coined from the Greek word

elektr on meaning amber . Many such pairs of materials wer e known which
on rubbing could attract light objects like straw, pith balls and bits of
papers.
It was observed that if two glass rods rubbed with wool or silk cloth
are brought close to each other , they r epel each other [Fig. 1.1(a)]. The
two strands of wool or two pieces of silk cloth, with which the rods were
rubbed, also r epel each other . However , the glass r od and wool attracted
each other . Similarly, two plastic r ods rubbed with cat’s fur r epelled each
other [Fig. 1.1(b)] but attracted the fur . On the other hand, the plastic
rod attracts the glass rod [Fig. 1.1(c)] and repel the silk or wool with
which the glass r od is rubbed. The glass r od repels the fur .
These seemingly simple facts  were established from years of efforts
and careful experiments and their analyses. It was concluded, after many
careful studies by different scientists, that there were only two kinds of
an entry which is called the electric char ge. We say that the bodies like
glass or plastic rods, silk, fur and pith balls are electrified. They acquire
an electric charge on rubbing. T here are two kinds of electrification and
we find  that (i) like charges repel  and (ii) unlike charges  attract  each
other . The pr operty which dif ferentiates the two kinds of char ges is called
the polarity  of charge.
When a glass rod is rubbed with silk, the rod acquires one kind of
charge and the silk acquires the second kind of charge. This is true for
any pair of objects that are rubbed to be electrified. Now if the electrified
glass rod is brought in contact with silk, with which it was rubbed, they
no longer attract each other . They also do not attract or r epel other light
objects as they did on being electrified.
Thus, the charges acquired after rubbing are lost when the charged
bodies are brought in contact. What can you conclude from these
observations? It just tells us that unlike charges acquired by the objects
neutralise or nullify each other’s effect. Therefore, the charges were named
as positive  and negative  by the American scientist Benjamin Franklin.
By convention, the charge on glass rod or cat’s fur is called positive and
that on plastic rod or silk is termed negative. If an object possesses an
electric charge, it is said to be electrified or charged. When it has no charge
it is said to be electrically neutral.FIGURE  1.1 Rods: like char ges repel and unlike char ges attract each other .

Electric Charges
and Fields
3A simple apparatus to detect charge  on a body  is the gold-leaf
electroscope [Fig. 1.2(a)]. It consists of a vertical metal rod housed in a
box, with two thin gold leaves attached to its bottom end. When a charged
object touches the metal knob at the top of the rod, charge flows on to
the leaves and they diverge. The degree of divergance is an indicator of
the amount of charge.
Try to understand why material bodies acquir e char ge. You know that
all matter is made up of atoms and/or molecules. Although normally the
materials are electrically neutral,  they do contain charges; but their charges
are exactly balanced. For ces that hold the molecules together , forces that
hold atoms together in a solid, the adhesive force of glue, forces associated
with surface tension, all are basically electrical in nature, arising from the
forces between charged particles. Thus the electric force is all pervasive and
it encompasses almost each and every field associated with our life. It is
therefore essential that we learn more about such a force.
To electrify a neutral body, we need to add or remove one kind of
charge. When we say that a body is charged, we always refer to this
excess charge or deficit of charge. In solids,  some of the electrons, being
less tightly bound in the atom, are the charges which are transferred
from one body to the other .  A body can thus be char ged positively by
losing some of its electrons. Similarly, a body can be charged negatively
by gaining electrons. When we rub a glass rod with silk, some of the
electrons from the rod are transferred to the silk cloth. Thus the rod gets
positively charged and the silk gets negatively charged. No new charge is
created in the process of rubbing. Also the number of electrons, that are
transferred, is a very small fraction of the total number of electrons in the
material body.
1.3  C ONDUCTORS  AND INSULA TORS
Some substances readily allow passage of electricity through them, others
do not.  Those which allow electricity to pass through them easily are
called conductors . They have electric charges (electrons) that are
comparatively free to move inside the material. Metals, human and animal
bodies and earth are conductors. Most of the non-metals like glass,
porcelain, plastic, nylon, wood offer high resistance to the passage of
electricity through them. They are called insulators . Most  substances
fall into one of the two classes stated above *.
When some char ge is transferr ed to a conductor , it r eadily gets
distributed over the entir e sur face of the conductor . In contrast, if some
charge is put on an insulator , it stays at the same place. Y ou will lear n
why this happens in the next chapter .
This property of the materials tells you why a nylon or plastic comb
gets electrified on combing dry hair or on rubbing, but a metal article
*There is a third category called semiconductors , which offer resistance to the
movement of charges which is intermediate between the conductors and
insulators.

like spoon does not. The charges on metal leak through
our body to the ground as both are conductors of
electricity. However , if a metal r od with a wooden or plastic
handle is rubbed without touching its metal part, it shows
signs of charging.
1.4  B ASIC PROPERTIES  OF ELECTRIC
CHARGE
We have seen that ther e are two types of char ges, namely
positive and negative and their effects tend to cancel each
other . Here,  we shall now describe some other pr operties
of the electric charge.
If the sizes of charged bodies are very small as
compared to the distances between them, we treat them
as point charges . All the charge content of the body is
assumed to be concentrated at one point in space .
1.4.1  Additivity of charges
We have not as yet given a quantitative definition of a
charge; we shall follow it  up in the next section. W e shall
tentatively assume that this can be done and proceed. If
a system contains two point charges q1 and q2, the total
charge of the system is obtained simply by adding
algebraically q1 and q2 , i.e., charges add up like real numbers or they
are scalars like the mass of a body. If a system contains n charges q1,
q2, q3, …, qn, then the total charge of the system is q1 + q2 + q3 + … + qn
.  Char ge has  magnitude but no dir ection, similar to mass. However ,
there is one difference between mass and charge. Mass of a body is
always positive whereas a charge can be either positive or negative.
Proper signs have to be used while adding the charges in a system. For
example, the total charge of a system containing five charges +1, +2, –3,
+4 and –5, in some arbitrary unit, is (+1) + (+2) + (–3) + (+4) + (–5) = –1 i n
the same unit.
1.4.2  Charge is conserved
We have alr eady  hinted to the fact that when bodies ar e char ged by
rubbing, there is transfer of electrons from one body to the other; no new
charges are either created or destroyed. A picture of particles of electric
charge enables us to understand the idea of conservation of charge. When
we rub two bodies, what one body gains in charge the other body loses.
Within an isolated system consisting of many charged bodies, due to
interactions among the bodies, charges may get redistributed but it is
found that the total charge of the isolated system is always conserved .
Conservation of charge has been established experimentally.
It is not possible to create or destroy net charge carried by any isolated
system although the charge carrying particles may be created or destroyedFIGURE  1.2 Electroscopes: (a)

5in a process. Sometimes nature creates charged particles: a neutron turns
into a proton and an electron. The proton and electron thus create d have
equal and opposite charges and the total charge is zero before and after
the creation.
1.4.3  Quantisation of charge
Experimentally it is established that all free charges are integral multiples
of a basic unit of charge denoted by e. Thus charge q on a body is always
given by
q = ne
wher e n is any integer , positive or negative. This basic unit of char ge is
the charge that an electron or proton carries. By convention, the charge
on an electron is taken to be negative; therefore charge on an electron is
written as –e and that on a proton as +e.
The fact that electric charge is always an integral multiple of e  is termed
as quanti sation of charge . There are a large number of situations in physics
where certain physical quantities are quanti sed. The quanti sation of charge
was first suggested by the experimental laws of electrolysis discovered by
English experimentalist Faraday. It was experimentally demonstrated by
Millikan in 1912.
In the International System (SI) of Units, a unit of charge is called a
coulomb  and is denoted by the symbol C. A coulomb is defined in terms
the unit of the electric current which you are going to learn in a
subsequent chapter . In ter ms of this definition, one coulomb is the char ge
flowing through a wire in 1 s if the current is 1 A (ampere), (see Chapter 1
of Class XI, Physics Textbook , Part I). In this system, the value of the
basic unit of charge is
e = 1.602192 × 10–19 C
Thus, there are about 6 × 1018 electrons in a charge of  –1C. In
electrostatics, charges of this large magnitude are seldom  encountered
and hence we use smaller units 1 mC (micro coulomb) = 10–6 C or 1 mC
(milli coulomb) = 10–3 C.
If the protons and electrons are the only basic charges in the
universe, all the observable charges have to be integral multiples of e.
Thus, if a body contains n1 electrons and n2 protons, the total amount
of charge on the body is n2 × e + n1 × (–e) = (n2 – n1) e. Since n1 and n2
are integers, their dif ference is also an integer . Thus the char ge on any
body is always an integral multiple of e and can be increased or
decreased also in steps of e.
The step size e is, however , very small because at the macr oscopic
level, we deal with charges of a few mC. At this scale the fact that charge of
a body can increase or decrease in units of e is not visible. In this respect,
the grainy nature of the charge is lost and it appears to be continuous.
This situation can be compared with the geometrical concepts of points
and lines. A dotted line viewed from a distance appears continuous to
us but is not continuous in reality. As many points very close to
Rationalised 2023-24
6Physics
 EXAMPLE  1.2  EXAMPLE  1.1each other normally give an impression of a continuous line, many
small charges taken together appear as a continuous charge distribution.
At the macroscopic level, one deals with charges that are enormous
compared to the magnitude of charge e . Since e = 1.6 × 10–19 C, a charge
of magnituOde, say 1 mC, contains something like 1013 times the electronic
charge. At this scale, the fact that charge can increase or decrease only in
units of e is not very different from saying that charge can take continuous
values. Thus, at the macroscopic level, the quantisation of charge has no
practical consequence and can be ignor ed. However , at the micr oscopic
level, where the charges involved are of the order of a few tens or hundreds
of e, i.e.,  they can be counted, they appear in discrete lumps and
quantisation of charge cannot be ignored. It is the magnitude of scale
involved that is very important.
Example 1.1  If 109 electrons move out of a body to another body
every second, how much time is required to get a total charge of 1 C
on the other body?
Solution  In one second 109 electrons move out of the body. Therefore
the charge given out in one second is 1.6 × 10–19 × 109 C = 1.6 × 10–10 C.
The time required to accumulate a charge of 1 C can then be estimated
to be 1 C ÷ (1.6 × 10–10 C/s) = 6.25 × 109 s = 6.25 × 109 ÷ (365  × 24 ×
3600) years = 198 years. Thus to collect a charge of one coulomb,
from a body from which 109 electrons move out every second, we will
need approximately 200 years. One coulomb is, therefore, a very large
unit for many practical purposes.
It is, however , also important to know what is r oughly the number of
electrons contained in a piece of one cubic centimetre of a material.
A cubic piece of copper of side 1 cm contains about 2.5 × 1024
electrons.
Example 1.2 How much positive and negative charge is there in a
cup of water?
Solution  Let us assume that the mass of one cup of water is
250 g. The molecular mass of water is 18g. Thus, one mole
(= 6.02 × 1023 molecules) of water is 18 g. Therefore the number of
molecules in one cup of water is (250/18) × 6.02 × 1023.
Each molecule of water contains two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen
atom, i.e., 10 electrons and 10 protons. Hence the total positive and
total negative charge has the same magnitude. It is equal to
(250/18) × 6.02 × 1023 × 10 × 1.6 × 10–19 C = 1.3 4 × 107 C.
1.5  C OULOMB ’S LAW
Coulomb’s law is a quantitative statement about the force between two
point charges. When the linear size of charged bodies are much smaller
than the distance separating them, the size may be ignored and the
charged bodies are treated as point charges . Coulomb measured the
force between two point charges and found that it varied inversely as
the square of the distance between the charges and was directly
proportional to the product of the magnitude of the two charges and
Rationalised 2023-24
Electric Charges

7acted along the line joining the two charges . Thus, if two
point charges q1, q2 are separated by a distance r in vacuum,
the magnitude of the force ( F) between them is given by
2 1
2q qF kr= (1.1)
How did Coulomb arrive at this law from his experiments?
Coulomb used a torsion balance *  for measuring the force
between two charged metallic spheres. When the separation
between two spheres is much larger than the radius of each
sphere, the charged spheres may be regarded as point charges.
However , the char ges on the spher es wer e unknown, to begin
with. How then could he discover a relation like Eq. (1.1)?
Coulomb thought of the following simple way: Suppose the
charge on a metallic sphere is q. If the sphere is put in contact
with an identical uncharged sphere, the charge will spread over
the two spheres. By symmetry, the charge on each sphere will
be q/2*. Repeating this process, we can get charges q/2, q/4,
etc. Coulomb varied the distance for a fixed pair of charges and
measured the force for different separations. He then varied the
charges in pairs, keeping the distance fixed for each pair .
Comparing forces for different pairs of  charges at different
distances, Coulomb arrived at the relation, Eq. (1.1).
Coulomb’s law, a simple mathematical statement,  was
initially experimentally arrived at  in the manner described
above. While the original experiments established it at a
macroscopic scale, it has also been established down to
subatomic level  ( r ~ 10–10 m).
Coulomb discovered his law without knowing the explicit
magnitude of the charge. In fact, it is the other way round:
Coulomb’s law can now be employed to furnish a definition
for a unit of charge. In the relation, Eq. (1.1), k is so far
arbitrary. W e can choose any positive value of k. The choice
of k determines the size of the unit of charge. In SI units, the
value of k is about 9 × 109 2
2Nm
C. The unit of charge that
results from this choice is called a coulomb which we defined
earlier in Section 1.4. Putting this value of k in Eq. (1.1), we
see that for q1 = q2 = 1 C, r = 1 m
F = 9 × 109 N
That is, 1 C is the charge that when placed at a distance
of 1 m from another charge of the same magnitude in vacuum
experiences an electrical force of repulsion of magnitude
*A torsion balance is a sensitive device to measure force. It was also used later
by Cavendish to measure the very feeble gravitational force between two objects,
to verify Newton’s Law of Gravitation.
*Implicit in this is the assumption of additivity of charges and conservation:
two charges ( q/2 each) add up to make a total charge  q.Charles Augustin de
Coulomb (1736 – 1806)
Coulomb, a French
physicist, began his
career as a military
engineer in the W est
Indies. In 1776, he
returned to Paris and
retired to a small estate
to do his scientific

measure the quantity of
a force and used it for
determination of forces

repulsion between small
charged spheres. He
thus arrived in 1785 at
the inverse square law

be used. In practice, in electrostatics, one uses
smaller units like 1 mC or 1 mC.

k = 1/4 pe0 for later convenience, so that Coulomb’s

Since for ce is a vector , it is better to write
Coulomb’s law in the vector notation. Let the position
vectors of charges q1 and q2 be r1 and r2 respectively
[see Fig.1.3(a)]. W e denote for ce on q1 due to q2 by
F12 and force on q2 due to q1 by F21. The two point
charges q1 and q2 have been numbered 1 and 2 for
convenience and the vector leading from 1 to 2 is
denoted by r21:
r21 = r2 – r1
In the same way, the vector leading from 2 to 1 is denoted by r12:
r12 = r1 – r2 = – r21
The magnitude of the vectors r21 and r12 is denoted by r21 and r12,
respectively ( r12 = r21). The direction of a vector is specified by a unit
vector along the vector . To denote the dir ection fr om 1 to 2 (or fr om 2 to
1), we define the unit vectors:

Some remarks on Eq. (1.3) are relevant:
·Equation (1.3) is valid for any sign of q1 and q2 whether positive or
negative. If q1 and q2 are of the same sign (either both positive or both
negative), F21 is along  ˆr21, which denotes repulsion, as it should be for
like charges. If q1 and q2 are of opposite signs, F21 is along –ɵr21(=ɵr12),
which denotes attraction, as expected for unlike charges. Thus, we do
not have to write separate equations for the cases of like and unlike
charges. Equation (1.3) takes care of both cases correctly [Fig. 1. 3(b)].FIGURE  1.3 (a) Geometry and

·Coulomb’s law [Eq. (1.3)] gives the force between two charges q1 and
q2 in vacuum. If the charges are placed in matter or the intervening
space has matter , the situation gets complicated due to the pr esence
of char ged constituents of matter . We shall consider electr ostatics in
matter in the next chapter .

between two protons is ~ 10-15 m inside a nucleus) are Fe ~ 230 N,
whereas, FG ~ 1.9 × 10–34 N.

the motion of electron and it undergoes very large accelerations

C and D are then removed and B is brought closer to A to a

What is the expected repulsion of A on the basis of Coulomb’s law?

1.6  F ORCES  BETWEEN  MULTIPLE C HARGES
The mutual electric force between two charges is given by
Coulomb’s law. How to calculate the force on a charge where
there are not one but several charges around? Consider a
system of n stationary charges q1, q2, q3, ..., qn in vacuum.
What is the force on q1 due to q2, q3, ..., qn? Coulomb’s law is
not enough to answer this question.  Recall that forces of
mechanical origin add according to the parallelogram law of
addition. Is the same true for forces of electrostatic origin?
Experimentally, it is verified that force on any charge  due
to a number of other charges is the vector sum of all the forces
on that charge due to the  other charges, taken one at a time.
The individual forces are unaffected due to the presence of
other charges . This is termed as the principle of superposition .
To better understand the concept, consider a system of
three charges q1, q2 and q3, as shown in Fig. 1.5(a) . The force
on one charge, say q1, due to two other charges q2, q3 can
therefore be obtained by performing a vector addition of the
forces due to each one of these charges. Thus, if the force on q1
due to q2 is denoted by F12, F12 is given by Eq. (1.3)  even
though other charges are present.
Thus, F12 =1

The above calculation of force can be generalised to a system of

The principle of superposition says that in a system of charges q1,
q2, ..., qn, the force on q1 due to q2 is the same as given by Coulomb’s law,
i.e., it is unaffected by the presence of the other charges q3, q4, ..., qn. The
total force F1 on the charge q1, due to all other charges, is then given by

Example 1.6 Consider the charges q, q, and – q placed at the vertices
of an equilateral triangle, as shown in Fig. 1.7. What is the force on
each charge?
FIGURE  1.7
Solution   The forces acting on charge q at A due to charges q at B
and –q at C are F12 along BA and F13 along AC respectively, as shown
in Fig. 1.7. By the parallelogram law, the total force F1 on the charge
q at A is given by
F1 = F 1ˆr where 1ˆr is a unit vector along BC.
The force of attraction or repulsion for each pair of charges has the

It is interesting to see that the sum of the forces on the three charges
is zero, i.e.,
F1 + F2 + F3 = 0
The result is not at all surprising. It follows straight from the fact
that Coulomb’s law is consistent with Newton’s third law. The proof
is left to you as an exercise.
1.7  E LECTRIC  FIELD
Let us consider a point charge Q placed in vacuum, at the origin O. If we
place another point char ge q at a point P , wher e OP = r, then the char ge Q
will exert a for ce on q as per Coulomb’s law. W e may ask the question: If
charge q is removed, then what is left in the surrounding? Is there
nothing? If ther e is nothing at the point P , then how does a for ce act
when we place the char ge q at P. In or der to answer such questions, the
early scientists introduced the concept of field. According to this, we say
that the charge Q produces an electric field everywhere in the surrounding.
When another char ge q is brought at some point P , the field ther e acts on
it and produces a force. The electric field produced by the charge Q  at a
point r is given as
E r r r ()= =1
41
402
02π πε εQ
rQ
rˆ ˆ(1.6)
where ˆ=r r/r, is a unit vector fr om the origin to the point r. Thus, Eq.(1.6)
specifies the value of the electric field for each value of the position
vector r. The wor d “field” signifies how some distributed quantity (which
could be a scalar or a vector) varies with position. The effect of the charge
has been incorporated in the existence of the electric field. W e obtain the
force F exerted by a charge  Q on a charge q, as
F r =1
402πεQq
rˆ(1.7)
Note that the charge q also exerts an equal and opposite force on the
charge Q. The electrostatic force between the charges Q and q can be
looked upon as an interaction between charge q and the electric field of
Q and vice versa. If we denote the position of char ge q by the vector r, it
experiences a force F equal to the charge q multiplied by the electric
field E at the location of q. Thus,
F(r) = q E(r) (1.8)
Equation (1.8) defines the SI unit of electric field as N/C *.
Some important remarks may be made here:
(i)From Eq. (1.8), we can infer that if q is unity, the electric field due to
a charge Q is numerically equal to the force exerted by it. Thus, the
electric field due to a charge  Q at a point in space may be defined
as the force that a unit positive charge would experience if placed
*An alter nate unit V/m will be intr oduced in the next chapter .FIGURE  1.8 Electric

15at that point . The charge Q, which is producing the electric field, is
called a source charge  and the charge q, which tests the effect of a
source charge, is called a test charge . Note that the source charge Q
must r emain at its original location. However , if a char ge q is brought
at any point around  Q, Q itself is bound to experience an electrical
force due to q and will tend to move. A way out of this difficulty is to
make q negligibly small. The force F is then negligibly small but the
ratio F/q is finite and defines the electric field:
EF=

→lim
q q0(1.9)
A practical way to get around the problem (of keeping Q undisturbed
in the presence of q) is to hold Q to its location by unspecified forces!
This may look strange but actually this is what happens in practice.
When we are considering the electric force on a test charge q due to a
charged planar sheet (Section 1.14), the charges on the sheet are held to
their locations by the forces due to the unspecified charged constituents
inside the sheet.
(ii)Note that the electric field E due to Q, though defined operationally in
terms of some test charge q, is independent of q. This is because
F is proportional to q, so the ratio F/q does not depend on q. The
force F on the charge q due to the charge Q depends on the particular
location of charge q which may take any value in the space around
the charge Q. Thus, the electric field E due to Q is also dependent on
the space coor dinate r. For dif ferent positions of the char ge q all over
the space , we get different values of electric field E. The field exists at
every point in three-dimensional space.
(iii)For a positive charge, the electric field will be directed radially
outwards from the charge. On the other hand, if the source charge is
negative, the electric field vector , at each point, points radially inwar ds.
(iv)Since the magnitude of the force F on charge q due to charge Q
depends only on the distance r of the charge q from charge Q,
the magnitude of the electric field E will also depend only on the
distance r. Thus at equal distances fr om the char ge Q, the magnitude
of its electric field E is same.  The magnitude of electric field E due to
a point charge is thus same on a sphere with the point charge at its
centre; in other words, it has a spherical symmetry.
1.7.1  Electric field due to a system of charges
Consider a system of charges q1, q2, ..., qn with  position vectors r1,
r2, ..., rn relative  to some origin O. Like the electric field at a point in
space due to a single charge, electric field at a point in space due to the
system of charges is defined to be the force experienced by a unit
test charge placed at that point, without disturbing the original
positions of char ges 
q1, q2, ..., qn. We can use Coulomb’s law and the
superposition principle to determine this field at a point P denoted by
position vector r.

1.7.2  Physical significance of electric field
You may wonder why the notion of electric field has been intr oduced
here at all. After all, for any system of charges, the measurable quantity
is the force on a charge which can be directly determined using Coulomb’s
law and the superposition principle [Eq. (1.5)]. Why then introduce this
intermediate quantity called the electric field?
For electrostatics, the concept of electric field is convenient, but not
really necessary. Electric field is an elegant way of characterising the
electrical environment of a system of charges. Electric field at a point in
the space around a system of charges tells you the force a unit positive
test charge would experience if placed at that point (without disturbing
the system). Electric field is a characteristic of the system of charges and
is independent of the test charge that you place at a point to determine
the field. The term field in physics generally refers to a quantity that is
defined at every point in space and may vary from point to point. Electric
field is a vector field, since force is a vector quantity.
The true physical significance of the concept of electric field, however ,
emerges only when we go beyond electrostatics and deal with time-
dependent electromagnetic phenomena. Suppose we consider the force
between two distant charges q1, q2 in accelerated motion. Now the greatest
speed with which a signal or information can go from one point to another
is c, the speed of light. Thus, the effect of any motion of q1 on q2 cannotFIGURE  1.9 Electric field at a point

vector sum of the electric fields at
the point due to individual charges.

17arise instantaneously. There will be some time delay between the effect
(force on q2) and the cause (motion of q1). It is precisely here that the
notion of electric field (strictly, electromagnetic field) is natural and very
useful. The field picture is this: the accelerated motion of charge q1
produces electromagnetic waves, which then propagate with the speed
c, reach q2 and cause a force on q2. The notion of field elegantly accounts
for the time delay. Thus, even though electric and magnetic fields can be
detected only by their effects (forces) on charges, they are regarded as
physical entities, not merely mathematical constructs. They have an
independent dynamics of their own,  i.e., they evolve according to laws
of their own. They can also transport energy. Thus, a source of time-
dependent electromagnetic fields, turned on for a short interval of time
and then switched off, leaves behind propagating electromagnetic fields
transporting energy. The concept of field was first introduced by Faraday
and is now among the central concepts in physics.
Example 1.7 An electron falls through a distance of 1.5 cm in a
uniform electric field of magnitude 2.0 × 104 N C–1 [Fig. 1.10(a)]. The
direction of the field is reversed keeping its magnitude unchanged
and a proton falls through the same distance [Fig. 1.10(b)]. Compute
the time of fall in each case. Contrast the situation with that of ‘free
fall under gravity’.
FIGURE  1.10
Solution In Fig. 1.10(a) the field is upward, so the negatively charged
electron experiences a downward force of magnitude eE where E is
the magnitude of the electric field. The acceleration of the electron is

where me is the mass of the electron.
Starting from rest, the time required by the electron to fall through a

For e = 1.6 × 10–19C, me = 9.11 × 10–31 kg,
     E = 2.0 × 104 N C–1, h = 1.5 × 10–2 m,
  te = 2.9 × 10–9s
In Fig. 1.10 (b), the field is downward, and the positively charged
proton experiences a downward force of magnitude eE. The
acceleration of the proton is
ap  =  eE/mp
where mp is the mass of the proton; mp = 1.67 × 10–27 kg. The time of

Thus, the heavier particle (proton) takes a greater time to fall through
the same distance. This is in basic contrast to the situation of ‘free
fall under gravity’ where the time of fall is independent of the mass of
the body. Note that in this example we have ignored the acceleration
due to gravity in calculating the time of fall. To see if this is justified,
let us calculate the acceleration of the proton in the given electric

which is enormous compared to the value of g (9.8 m s–2), the

in this example.

1.8  E LECTRIC F IELD LINES
We have studied electric field in the last section. It is a vector quantity
and can be represented as we represent vectors. Let us try to represent E
due to a point charge pictorially. Let the point charge be placed at the
origin. Draw vectors pointing along the direction of the
electric field with their lengths proportional to the strength
of the field at each point. Since the magnitude of electric
field at a point decreases inversely as the square of the
distance of that point from the charge, the vector gets
shorter as one goes away from the origin, always pointing
radially outward. Figure 1.12 shows such a picture.  In
this figure, each arrow indicates the electric field, i.e., the
force acting on a unit positive charge, placed at the tail of
that arrow.  Connect the arrows pointing in one direction
and the r esulting figur e represents a field line. W e thus
get many field lines, all pointing outwards from the point
charge. Have we lost the information about the strength
or magnitude of the field now, because it was contained
in the length of the arrow? No. Now the magnitude of the
field is represented by the density of field lines. E is strong
near the charge, so the density of field lines is more near
the char ge and the lines ar e closer . Away fr om the char ge,
the field gets weaker and the density of field lines is less,
resulting in well-separated lines.
Another person may draw more lines. But the number of lines is not
important. In fact, an infinite number of lines can be drawn in any region.FIGURE  1.12 Field of a point charge. EXAMPLE  1.8
Rationalised 2023-24
20Physics
It is the relative density of lines in different regions which is
important.
We draw the figur e on the plane of paper , i.e., in two-
dimensions but we live in three-dimensions. So if one wishes
to estimate the density of field lines, one has to consider the
number of lines per unit cross-sectional area, perpendicular
to the lines.  Since the electric field decreases as the square of
the distance from a point charge and the area enclosing the
charge increases as the square of the distance, the number
of field lines crossing the enclosing area remains constant,
whatever may be the distance of the area from the charge.
We started by saying that the field lines carry infor mation
about the direction of electric field at different points in space.
Having drawn a certain set of field lines, the relative density
(i.e., closeness) of the field lines at different points indicates
the relative strength of electric field at those points. The field
lines crowd where the field is strong and are spaced apart
wher e it is weak. Figur e 1.13 shows a set of field lines. W e
can imagine two equal and small elements of area placed at points R and
S normal to the field lines there. The number of field lines in our picture
cutting the area elements is proportional to the magnitude of field at
these points. The picture shows that the field at R is stronger than at S.
To understand the dependence of the field lines on the area, or rather
the solid angle subtended by an area element, let us try to relate the
area with the solid angle, a generalisation of angle to three dimensions.
Recall how a (plane) angle is defined in two-dimensions. Let a small
transverse line element Dl  be placed at a distance r from a point O. Then
the angle subtended by D
l  at O can be appr oximated as Dq = Dl/r.
Likewise, in three-dimensions the solid angle * subtended by a small
perpendicular plane ar ea DS, at a distance r, can be written as
DW = DS/r2. We know that in a given solid angle the number of radial
field lines is the same. In Fig. 1.13, for two points P1 and P2 at distances
r1 and r2 from the charge, the element of area subtending the solid angle
DW is 2
1rDW at P1 and an element of area 2
2rDW at P2, respectively. The
number of lines (say n) cutting these area elements are the same. The
number of field lines, cutting unit area element is therefore n/(2
1rDW) at
P1 and n/(2
2rDW) at P2, respectively. Since n and DW are common, the
strength of the field clearly has a 1/ r2 dependence.
The picture of field lines was invented by Faraday to develop an
intuitive non-mathematical way of visualising electric fields around
charged configurations. Faraday called them lines of for ce. This ter m is
somewhat misleading, especially in case of magnetic fields. The more
appr opriate ter m is field lines  (electric or magnetic) that we have
adopted in this book.
Electric field lines are thus a way of pictorially mapping the electric
field around a configuration of charges. An electric field line is, in general,FIGURE  1.13  Dependence of
electric field strength on the
distance and its relation to the
number of field lines.
*Solid angle is a measure of a cone. Consider the intersection of the given cone
with a sphere of radius R. The solid angle DW of the cone is defined to be equal
to DS/R2, where DS is the area on the sphere cut out by the cone.

21a curve drawn in such a way that the tangent to it at each
point is in the direction of the net field at that point. An
arrow on the curve is obviously necessary to specify the
direction of electric field from the two possible directions
indicated by a tangent to the curve. A field line is a space
curve, i.e., a curve in three dimensions.
Figure 1.14 shows the field lines around some simple
charge configurations. As mentioned earlier , the field lines
are in 3-dimensional space, though the figure shows them
only in a plane. The field lines of a single positive charge
are radially outward while those of a single negative
charge are radially inward. The field lines around a system
of two positive charges ( q, q) give a vivid pictorial
description of their mutual repulsion, while those around
the configuration of two equal and opposite charges
(q, –q), a dipole, show clearly the mutual attraction
between the charges. The field lines follow some important
general properties:
(i)Field lines start from positive charges and end at
negative charges. If there is a single charge, they may
start or end at infinity.
(ii)In a charge-free region, electric field lines can be taken
to be continuous curves without any breaks.
(iii)Two field lines can never cr oss each other . (If they did,
the field at the point of intersection will not have a
unique direction, which is absurd.)
(iv)Electrostatic field lines do not form any closed loops.
This follows from the conservative nature of electric
field (Chapter 2).
1.9  E LECTRIC  FLUX
Consider flow of a liquid with velocity v, through a small
flat surface d S, in a direction normal to the surface. The
rate of flow of liquid is given by the volume crossing the
area per unit time  v dS and represents the flux of liquid
flowing across the plane. If the normal to the surface is
not parallel to the direction of flow of liquid, i.e., to v , but
makes an angle q with it, the projected area in a plane
perpendicular to v is δdS cos q. Therefore, the flux going
out of the surface d S is v.ˆndS. For the case of  the electric
field, we define an analogous quantity and call it electric
flux. We should, however , note that ther e is no flow of a
physically observable quantity unlike the case of
liquid flow.
In the picture of electric field lines described above,
we saw that the number of field lines crossing a unit area,
placed normal to the field at a point is a measure of the
strength of electric field at that point. This means that ifFIGURE  1.14 Field lines due to
some simple charge configurations.
Rationalised 2023-24
22Physics
we place a small planar element of area DS
normal to E at a point, the number of field lines
crossing it is proportional * to E DS. Now
suppose we tilt the area element by angle q.
Clearly, the number of field lines crossing the
area element will be smaller . The pr ojection of
the area element normal to E is DS cos q. Thus,
the number of field lines crossing DS is
proportional to E DS cos q. When q = 90°, field
lines will be parallel to DS and will not cross it
at all (Fig. 1.15).
The orientation of area element and not
merely its magnitude is important in many
contexts. For example, in a stream, the amount
of water flowing through a ring will naturally
depend on how you hold the ring. If you hold
it normal to the flow, maximum water will flow
through it than if you hold it with some other
orientation. This shows that an area element
should be tr eated as a vector . It has a
magnitude and also a direction. How to specify the direction of a planar
area? Clearly, the normal to the plane specifies the orientation of the
plane. Thus the direction of a planar area vector is along its normal.
How to associate a vector to the ar ea of a curved sur face? W e imagine
dividing the surface into a large number of very small area elements.
Each small area element may be treated as planar and a vector associated
with it, as explained before.
Notice one ambiguity here. The direction of an area element is along
its normal. But a normal can point in two directions. Which direction do
we choose as the direction of the vector associated with the area element?
This problem is resolved by some convention appropriate to the given
context. For the case of a closed surface, this convention is very simple.
The vector associated with every area element of a closed surface is taken
to be in the direction of the outward  normal. This is the convention used
in Fig. 1.16. Thus, the area element vector DS at a point on a closed
surface equals DS ˆn where D S is the magnitude of the area element and
ˆn is a unit vector in the direction of outward normal at that point.
We now come to the definition of electric flux. Electric flux Df through
an area element DS is defined by
Df = E.DS = E DS  cos q (1.11)
which, as seen before, is proportional to the number of field lines cutting
the area element. The angle q here is the angle between E and DS. For a
closed surface, with the convention stated already, q is the angle between
E and the outward normal   to the area element. Notice we could look at
the expression E DS cos q  in two ways:  E ( DS cos q ) i.e., E times theFIGURE  1.15  Dependence of flux on the
inclination q between E and ˆn.

ˆn and DS. *It will not be proper to say that the number of field lines is equal to E DS. The
number of field lines is after all, a matter of how many field lines we choose to
draw. What is physically significant is the relative number of field lines crossing
a given area at different points.

23projection of area normal to E,  or E^ DS, i.e., component of E along the
normal to the area element times the magnitude of the area element. The
unit of electric flux is N C–1 m2.
The basic definition of electric flux given by Eq. (1.11) can be used, in
principle, to calculate the total flux through any given surface. All we
have to do is to divide the surface into small area elements, calculate the
flux at each element and add them up. Thus, the total flux f through a
surface S is
f ~ S E.DS (1.12)
The approximation sign is put because the electric field E is taken to
be constant over the small area element. This is mathematically exact
only when you take the limit DS ® 0  and the sum in Eq. (1.12) is written
as an integral.
1.10  E LECTRIC  DIPOLE
An electric dipole is a pair of equal and opposite point charges q and – q,
separated by a distance 2 a. The line connecting the two charges defines
a direction in space. By convention, the direction from – q to q is said to
be the direction of the dipole. The mid-point of locations of – q and q is
called the centre of the dipole.
The total charge of the electric dipole is obviously zero. This does not
mean that the field of the electric dipole is zero. Since the charge q and
–q are separated by some distance, the electric fields due to them, when
added, do not exactly cancel out. However , at distances much lar ger than
the separation of the two charges forming a dipole ( r >> 2 a), the fields
due to q and – q nearly cancel out. The electric field due to a dipole
therefore falls off, at large distance, faster than like 1/ r2 (the dependence
on r of the field due to a single charge q). These qualitative ideas are
borne out by the explicit calculation as follows:
1.10.1  The field of an electric dipole
The electric field of the pair of charges (– q 
and q) at any point in space
can be found out from Coulomb’s law and the superposition principle.
The results are simple for the following two cases: (i) when the point is on
the dipole axis, and (ii) when it is in the equatorial plane  of the dipole,
i.e.,  on a plane perpendicular to the dipole axis through its centre.  The
electric field at any general point P is obtained by adding the electric
fields E–q due to the charge – q and E+q due to the charge q, by the
parallelogram law of vectors.
(i) For points on the axis
Let the point P be at distance r from the centre of the dipole on the side of
the charge q,  as shown in Fig. 1.17(a). Then

The directions of  E+q and E–q are as shown in

axis cancel away. The components along the dipole axis
add up. The total electric field is opposite to ˆp. We have

From Eqs. (1.15) and (1.18), it is clear that the dipole field at large
distances does not involve q and a separately; it depends on the product
qa. This suggests the definition of dipole moment. The dipole moment
vector  p of an electric dipole is defined by
p  = q × 2a ˆp (1.19)
that is, it is a vector whose magnitude is charge q times the separation
2a (between the pair of charges q, –q) and the direction is along the line
from – q to q. In terms of p, the electric field of a dipole at large distances
takes simple forms:

 EXAMPLE  1.9 Notice the important point that the dipole field at large distances
falls of f not as 1/ r2 but as1/ r3. Further ,  the magnitude and the dir ection
of the dipole field depends not only on the distance r but also on the
angle  between the position vector r and the dipole moment p.
We can think of the limit when the dipole size 2 a appr oaches zer o,
the charge q approaches infinity in such a way that the product
p = q × 2a is finite. Such a dipole is referred to as a point dipole . For a
point dipole, Eqs. (1.20) and (1.21) ar e exact, true for any r.
1.10.2  Physical significance of dipoles
In most molecules, the centres of positive charges and of negative charges *
lie at the same place. Therefore, their dipole moment is zero. CO2 and
CH4 are of this type of molecules. However , they develop a dipole moment
when an electric field is applied. But in some molecules, the centres of
negative charges and of positive charges do not coincide. Therefore they
have a permanent electric dipole moment, even in the absence of an electric
field. Such molecules are called polar molecules. W ater molecules, H2O,
is an example of this type. V arious materials give rise to inter esting
properties and important applications in the presence or  absence of
electric field.
Example 1.9 Two charges ±10 mC are placed 5.0 mm apart. Determine
the electric field at (a) a point P on the axis of the dipole 15 cm away
from its centre O on the side of the positive charge, as shown in Fig.
1.18(a), and (b) a point Q, 15 cm away from O on a line passing through
O and normal to the axis of the dipole, as shown in Fig. 1.18(b).

1.11  D IPOLE IN A UNIFORM  EXTERNAL  FIELD
Consider a permanent dipole of dipole moment p in a uniform
external field E, as shown in Fig. 1.19. (By permanent dipole, we
mean that p exists  irrespective of E; it has not been induced by E.)
There is a force qE on q and a force – qE on – q. The net force on
the dipole is zer o, since E is unifor m. However , the char ges ar e
separated, so the forces act at different points, resulting in a torque
on the dipole. When the net force is zero, the torque (couple) is
independent of the origin. Its magnitude equals the magnitude of
each force multiplied by the arm of the couple (perpendicular
distance between the two antiparallel forces).
Magnitude of torque = q E × 2 a sinq
       = 2 q a E  sinq
Its dir ection is nor mal to the plane of the paper , coming out of it.
The magnitude of p × E is also p E sinq and its direction
is nor mal to the paper , coming out of it. Thus,
t tt tt  = p × E (1.22)
This torque will tend to align the dipole with the field
E. When p is aligned with E, the torque is zero.
What happens if the field is not uniform? In that case,
the net force will evidently be non-zero. In addition there
will, in general, be a torque on the system as before. The
general case is involved, so let us consider the simpler
situations when p is parallel to E or antiparallel to E. In
either case, the net torque is zero, but there is a net force
on the dipole if E is not uniform.
Figure 1.20 is self-explanatory. It is easily seen that
when p is parallel to E, the dipole has a net force in the
direction of increasing field. When p is antiparallel to E,
the net force on the dipole is in the direction of decreasing
field. In general, the force depends on the orientation of p
with respect to E.
This brings us to a common observation in frictional
electricity. A comb run through dry hair attracts pieces of
paper . The comb, as we know, acquir es char ge thr ough
friction. But the paper is not charged. What then explains
the attractive force? Taking the clue from the precedingFIGURE  1.19 Dipole in a
uniform electric field.
FIGURE  1.20 Electric force on a
dipole: (a) E parallel to p, (b)  E

Rationalised 2023-24
28Physics
discussion, the char ged comb ‘polarises’ the piece of paper , i.e., induces
a net dipole moment in the dir ection of field. Further , the electric field
due to the comb is not uniform. This non-uniformity of the field makes a
dipole to experience a net force on it. In this situation, it is easily seen
that the paper should move in the direction of the comb!
1.12  C ONTINUOUS  CHARGE  DISTRIBUTION
We have so far dealt with char ge configurations involving discr ete char ges
q1, q2, ..., qn. One reason why we restricted to discrete charges is that the
mathematical treatment is simpler and does not involve calculus. For
many purposes, however , it is impractical to work in ter ms of discr ete
charges and we need to work with continuous charge distributions. For
example, on the sur face of a char ged conductor , it is impractical to specify
the charge distribution in terms of the locations of the microscopic charged
constituents. It is more feasible to consider an area element DS (Fig. 1.21)
on the surface of the conductor (which is very small on the macroscopic
scale but big enough to include a very large number of electrons) and
specify the char ge DQ on that element. W e then define a surface char ge
density  s at the area element by
Q
SσΔ=Δ(1.23)
We can do this at dif ferent points on the conductor and thus arrive at
a continuous function s, called the surface charge density. The surface
charge density s  so defined ignores the quantisation of charge and the
discontinuity in charge distribution at the microscopic level *. s  represents
macroscopic surface charge density, which in a sense, is a smoothed out
average of the microscopic charge density over an area element DS which,
as said before, is large microscopically but small macroscopically. The
units for s are C/m2.
Similar considerations apply for a line charge distribution and a volume
charge distribution. The linear charge density  l of a wire is defined by
Q
lλΔ=Δ(1.24)
where Dl is a small line element of wire on the macroscopic scale that,
however , includes a lar ge number of micr oscopic char ged constituents,
and DQ is the charge contained in that line element. The units for l are
C/m. The volume charge density  (sometimes simply called charge density)
is defined in a similar manner:
Q
VρΔ=Δ(1.25)
where DQ is the charge included in the macroscopically small volume
element DV that includes a large number of microscopic charged
constituents. The units for r are C/m3.
The notion of continuous charge distribution is similar to that we
adopt for continuous mass distribution in mechanics. When we refer toFIGURE  1.21
Definition of linear ,
surface and volume
charge densities.
In each case, the
element ( Dl, DS, DV)
chosen is small on
the macroscopic
scale but contains
a very large number
of microscopic
constituents.
*At the microscopic level, charge distribution is discontinuous, because they are
discrete charges separated by intervening space where there is no charge.

29the density of a liquid, we are referring to its macroscopic density. We
regard it as a continuous fluid and ignore its discrete molecular
constitution.
The field due to a continuous charge distribution can be obtained in
much the same way as for a system of discrete charges, Eq. (1.10). Suppose
a continuous char ge distribution in space has a char ge density r. Choose
any convenient origin O and let the position vector of any point in the
charge distribution be r. The char ge density r may vary fr om point to
point, i.e., it is a function of r. Divide the char ge distribution into small
volume elements of size DV. The char ge in a volume element DV is rDV.
Now, consider any general point P (inside or outside the distribution)
with position vector R (Fig. 1.21). Electric field due to the charge rDV is
given by Coulomb’s law:
2
01ˆ
4V'r'ρ
εΔΔ =πE r (1.26)
wher e r¢ is the distance between the char ge element and P , and  ˆr¢ is a
unit vector in the dir ection fr om the char ge element to P . By the
superposition principle, the total electric field due to the charge
distribution is obtained by summing over electric fields due to different
volume elements:
2
01ˆ
4all VV'r'ρ
εΔΔ≅ ΣπE r (1.27)
Note that r, r¢,  ˆ′r all can vary fr om point to point. In a strict
mathematical method, we should let DV®0 and the sum then becomes
an integral; but we omit that discussion here, for simplicity. In short,
using Coulomb’s law and the superposition principle, electric field can
be determined for any charge distribution, discrete or continuous or part
discrete and part continuous.
1.13  G AUSS’S LAW
As a simple application of the notion of electric flux, let us consider the
total flux thr ough a spher e of radius r, which encloses a point char ge q
at its centre. Divide the sphere into small area elements, as shown in
Fig. 1.22.
The flux through an area element DS is
2
0ˆ
4q
rφεΔ = Δ = ΔπE S r Sii (1.28)
where we have used Coulomb’s law for the electric field due to a single
charge q. The unit vector ˆr is along the radius vector from the centre to
the area element. Now, since the normal to a sphere at every point is
along the radius vector at that point, the area element DS and ˆr  have
the same direction. Therefore,
2
04qSrφεΔ = Δπ(1.29)
since the magnitude of a unit vector is 1.
The total flux through the sphere is obtained by adding up flux
through all the different area elements:FIGURE  1.22  Flux

Equation (1.30) is a simple illustration of a general result of
electrostatics called Gauss’s law.
We state Gauss’s law  without pr oof:
Electric flux through a closed surface S
= q/ e0(1.31)
q = total charge enclosed by S.
The law implies that the total electric flux through a closed surface is
zero if no char ge is enclosed by the sur face. W e can see that explicitly in
the simple situation of Fig. 1.23.
Here the electric field is uniform and we are considering a closed
cylindrical surface, with its axis parallel to the uniform field E . The total
flux f  through the surface is  f = f1 + f2 + f3, where f1 and f2 represent
the flux through the surfaces 1 and 2 (of circular cross-section) of the
cylinder and f3 is the flux through the curved cylindrical part of the
closed surface. Now the normal to the surface 3 at every point is
perpendicular to E, so by definition of flux,  f3 = 0. Further , the outwar d
normal to 2 is along E while the outward normal to 1 is opposite to E.
Therefore,
f1 = –E S1,     f2 = +E S2
S1 = S2 = S
where  S is the area of circular cross-section. Thus, the total flux is zero,
as expected by Gauss’s law. Thus, whenever you find that the net electric
flux through a closed surface is zero, we conclude that the total charge
contained in the closed surface is zero.
The great significance of Gauss’s law Eq. (1.31), is that it is true in
general, and not only for the simple cases we have considered above. Let
us note some important points regarding this law:
(i)Gauss’s law is true for any closed surface, no matter what its shape
or size.
(ii)The term q on the right side of Gauss’s law, Eq. (1.31), includes the
sum of all charges enclosed by the surface. The charges may be located
anywhere inside the surface.
(iii)In the situation when the surface is so chosen that there are some
charges inside and some outside, the electric field [whose flux appears
on the left side of Eq. (1.31)] is due to all the charges, both inside and
outside S. The ter m q on the right side of Gauss’s law, however ,
represents only the total charge inside S.

 EXAMPLE  1.10(iv)The surface that we choose for the application of Gauss’s law is called
the Gaussian sur face. Y ou may choose any Gaussian sur face and
apply Gauss’s law. However , take car e not to let the Gaussian sur face
pass through any discrete charge. This is because electric field due
to a system of discrete charges is not well defined at the location of
any charge. (As you go close to the charge, the field grows without
any bound.) However , the Gaussian sur face can pass thr ough a
continuous charge distribution.
(v)Gauss’s law is often useful towards a much easier calculation of the
electrostatic field when the system has some symmetry.  This is
facilitated by the choice of a suitable Gaussian surface.
(vi) Finally, Gauss’s law is based on the inverse square dependence on
distance contained in the Coulomb’s law. Any violation of Gauss’s
law will indicate departure from the inverse square law.

Ex = ax1/2, Ey = Ez = 0, in which a = 800 N/C m1/2. Calculate (a) the
flux through the cube, and (b) the charge within the cube. Assume
that a = 0.1 m.
FIGURE  1.24
Solution
(a)Since the electric field has only an x component, for faces
perpendicular to x direction, the angle between E and DS is
± p/2. Therefore, the flux  f = E.DS is separately zero for each face

the electric field at the left face is
EL = ax1/2 = aa1/2

fR =  E.DS =  + 1.57 N m2 C–1.

331.14  A PPLICA TIONS OF GAUSS’S LAW
The electric field due to a general charge distribution is, as seen above,
given by Eq. (1.27). In practice, except for some special cases, the
summation (or integration) involved in this equation cannot be carried
out to give electric field at every point in
space. For some symmetric charge
configurations, however , it is possible to
obtain the electric field in a simple way using
the Gauss’s law. This is best understood by
some examples.
1.14.1 Field due to an infinitely
long straight uniformly
charged wire
Consider an infinitely long thin straight wire
with uniform linear charge density l. The wire
is obviously an axis of symmetry. Suppose we
take the radial vector from O to P and rotate it
around the wir e. The points P , P¢, P¢¢ so
obtained are completely equivalent with
respect to the charged wire. This implies that
the electric field must have the same magnitude
at these points. The direction of electric field at
every point must be radial (outward if l > 0,
inward if l < 0). This is clear from Fig. 1.2 6.
Consider a pair of line elements P1 and P2
of the wire, as shown. The electric fields
produced by the two elements of the pair when
summed give a resultant electric field which
is radial (the components normal to the radial
vector cancel). This is true for any such pair
and hence the total field at any point P is
radial. Finally, since the wire is infinite,
electric field does not depend on the position
of P along the length of the wire. In short, the
electric field is everywhere radial in the plane
cutting the wire normally, and its magnitude
depends only on the radial distance r.
To calculate the field, imagine a cylindrical
Gaussian surface, as shown in the Fig. 1.2 6(b).
Since the field is everywhere radial, flux
through the two ends of the cylindrical
Gaussian surface is zero. At the cylindrical
part of the surface, E is normal to the surface
at every point, and its magnitude is constant,
since it depends only on r. The surface ar ea
of the curved part is  2 prl, where l is the length
of the cylinder .FIGURE 1.26 (a) Electric field due to an

Flux through the Gaussian surface

=E × 2prl
The surface includes charge equal to l l. Gauss’s law then gives
E × 2prl = ll/e0
i.e.,E  = 
02rλ
επ
Vectorially, E at any point is given by
0ˆ
2rλ
ε=πE n (1.32)
where ˆn is the radial unit vector in the plane normal to the wire passing
through the point. E is directed outward if l is positive and inward if l is
negative.
Note that when we write a vector A as a scalar multiplied by a unit
vector , i.e., as A = A ˆa, the scalar A is  an algebraic number . It can be
negative or positive. The direction of A will be the same as that of the unit
vector ˆaif A > 0 and opposite to ˆa if A < 0. When we want to restrict to
non-negative values, we use the symbol Aand call it the modulus of A.
Thus, 0≥A .
Also note that though only  the charge enclosed by the surface ( ll)
was included above, the electric field E is due to the charge on the entire
wire. Further , the assumption that the wir e is infinitely long is crucial.
Without this assumption, we cannot take E to be normal to the curved
part of the cylindrical Gaussian sur face. However , Eq. (1.32) is
approximately true for electric field around the central portions of a long
wire, where the end effects may be ignored.
1.14.2  Field due to a uniformly charged infinite plane sheet
Let s be the uniform surface charge density of an infinite plane sheet
(Fig. 1.27). W e take the x-axis nor mal to the given plane. By symmetry,
the electric field will not depend on y and z coordinates and its direction
at every point must be parallel to the x-direction.
We can take the Gaussian sur face to be a
rectangular parallelepiped of cross-sectional area
A, as shown. (A cylindrical surface will also do.) As
seen from the figure, only the two faces 1 and 2 will
contribute to the flux; electric field lines are parallel
to the other faces and they, therefore, do not
contribute to the total flux.
The unit vector normal to surface 1 is in – x
direction while  the unit  vector normal to surface 2
is in the + x direction. Therefore, flux  E.DS through
both the surfaces are equal and add up. Therefore
the net flux through the Gaussian surface is 2 EA.
The charge enclosed by the closed surface is sA.
Therefore by Gauss’s law,FIGURE  1.27  Gaussian surface for a

E is directed away from the plate if s  is positive and toward the plate
if s is negative. Note that the above application of the Gauss’ law has
brought out an additional fact: E is independent of x also.
For a finite large planar sheet, Eq. (1.33) is approximately true in the
middle regions of the planar sheet, away from the ends.
1.14.3   Field due to a uniformly charged thin spherical shell
Let s be the uniform surface charge density of a thin spherical shell of
radius R (Fig. 1.28). The situation has obvious spherical symmetry. The
field at any point P , outside or inside, can depend only on r (the radial
distance from the centre of the shell to the point) and must be radial (i.e.,
along the radius vector).
(i)Field outside the shell:  Consider a point P outside the
shell with radius vector r. To calculate E at P, we take the
Gaussian surface to be a sphere of radius r and with centre
O, passing thr ough P . All points on this spher e are equivalent
relative to the given charged configuration. (That is what we
mean by spherical symmetry.) The electric field at each point
of the Gaussian surface, therefore, has the same magnitude
E and is along the radius vector at each point. Thus, E and
DS at every point are parallel and the flux through each
element is E DS. Summing over all DS, the flux through the
Gaussian surface is E × 4 p r2. The charge enclosed is
s × 4 p R2. By Gauss’s law
E × 4 p r2 = 2

where q  =  4 p R2 s is the total charge on the spherical shell.

rε=πE r (1.34)
The electric field is directed outward if q > 0 and inward if
q < 0. This, however , is exactly the field pr oduced by a char ge
q placed at the centre O. Thus for points outside the shell, the field due
to a uniformly charged shell is as if  the entire charge of the shell is
concentrated at its centre.
(ii)Field inside the shell:  In Fig. 1.28(b), the point P is inside the
shell. The Gaussian surface is again a sphere through P centred at O.FIGURE  1.28  Gaussian

(a) r > R, (b) r < R.

 EXAMPLE  1.12The flux through the Gaussian surface, calculated as before, is
E × 4 p r2. However , in this case, the Gaussian sur face encloses no
charge. Gauss’s law then gives
E × 4 p r2 =  0
i.e., E = 0          ( r < R ) (1.35)
that is, the field due to a uniformly charged thin shell is zero at all points
inside the shell *. This important result is a direct consequence of Gauss’s
law which follows from Coulomb’s law. The experimental verification of
this result confirms the 1/ r2 dependence in Coulomb’s law.
Example 1.12 An early model for an atom considered it to have a
positively charged point nucleus of charge Ze, surrounded by a
uniform density of negative charge up to a radius R. The atom as a
whole is neutral. For this model, what is the electric field at a distance
r from the nucleus?
FIGURE  1.29
Solution   The charge distribution for this model of the atom is as
shown in Fig. 1.29. The total negative charge in the uniform spherical
charge distribution of radius R must be – Z e, since the atom (nucleus
of charge Z e + negative charge) is neutral. This immediately gives us
the negative char ge density r, since we must have
340–3RZeρπ=
or 33
4Ze
Rρ=−π
To find the electric field E(r) at a point P which is a distance r away
from the nucleus, we use Gauss’s law. Because of the spherical
symmetry of the charge distribution, the magnitude of the electric
field E(r) depends only on the radial distance, no matter what the
direction of r. Its dir ection is along (or opposite to) the radius vector r
from the origin to the point P . The obvious Gaussian sur face is a
spherical sur face centr ed at the nucleus. W e consider two situations,
namely, r < R and r > R.
(i) r < R : The electric flux f enclosed by the spherical surface is
    f  =  E (r) × 4 p r2

the field at any point on the spherical Gaussian surface has the
same direction as the normal to the surface there,  and has the same
magnitude at all points on the surface.

charge and the negative char ge within the spher e of radius r,

The electric field is directed radially outward.
(ii) r > R:  In this case, the total charge enclosed by the Gaussian
spherical surface is zero since the atom is neutral. Thus, from Gauss’s
law,
E (r) × 4 p  r2 = 0  or  E (r) = 0;    r > R
At r = R, both cases give the same result: E = 0.
SUMMARY
1.Electric and magnetic forces determine the properties of atoms,
molecules and bulk matter .
2.From simple experiments on frictional electricity, one can infer that
there are two types of charges in nature; and that like charges repel
and unlike charges attract. By convention, the charge on a glass rod
rubbed with silk is positive; that on a plastic rod rubbed with fur is
then negative.
3.Conductors allow movement of electric charge through them,
insulators do not. In metals, the mobile charges are electrons; in
electrolytes both positive and negative ions are mobile.
4.Electric charge has three basic properties: quantisation, additivity
and conservation.
Quantisation of electric charge means that total charge ( q) of a body
is always an integral multiple of a basic quantum of charge ( e) i.e.,
q = n e, where n = 0, ±1, ±2, ±3, .... Proton and electron have charges
+e, –e, respectively. For macroscopic charges for which n is a very large
number , quantisation of char ge can be ignor ed.
Additivity of electric charges means that the total charge of a system
is the algebraic sum (i.e., the sum taking into account proper signs)
of all individual charges in the system.
Conservation of electric charges means that the total charge of an
isolated system remains unchanged with time. This means that when
Rationalised 2023-24
38Physics
bodies are charged through friction, there is a transfer of electric charge
from one body to another , but no cr eation or destruction
of charge.
5.Coulomb’s Law : The mutual electrostatic force between two point
charges q1 and q2 is proportional to the product q1q2 and inversely
proportional to the square of the distance r21 separating them.
Mathematically,
F21 = force on q2 due to  1 2
1 21 2
21ˆk (q q )qr= r
where 21ˆr is a unit vector in the direction from q1 to q2 and k =  
01
4επ
is the constant of proportionality.
In SI units, the unit of charge is coulomb. The experimental value of
the constant e0 is
e0 = 8.854 × 10–12 C2 N–1 m–2
The approximate value of k is
k = 9 × 109 N m2 C–2
6.The ratio of electric force and gravitational force between a proton
and an electron is

e pk e.G m m≅ ×
7.Superposition Principle : The principle is based on the property that the
forces with which two charges attract or repel each other are not
affected by the presence of a third (or more) additional charge(s). For
an assembly of charges q1, q2, q3, ..., the force on any charge, say q1, is
the vector sum of the force on  q1 due to q2, the force on  q1 due to q3,
and so on. For each pair , the for ce is given by the Coulomb’s law for
two char ges stated earlier .
8.The electric field E at a point due to a charge configuration is the
force on a small positive test charge q placed at the point divided by
the magnitude of the charge. Electric field due to a point charge q has
a magnitude | q|/4pe0r2; it is radially outwards from q, if q is positive,
and radially inwards if q is negative. Like Coulomb force, electric field
also satisfies superposition principle.
9.An electric field line is a curve drawn in such a way that the tangent
at each point on the curve gives the direction of electric field at that
point. The relative closeness of field lines indicates the relative strength
of electric field at different points; they crowd near each other in regions
of strong electric field and are far apart where the electric field is
weak. In regions of constant electric field, the field lines are uniformly
spaced parallel straight lines.
10.Some of the important properties of field lines are: (i) Field lines are
continuous curves without any breaks. (ii) Two field lines cannot cross
each other . (iii) Electr ostatic field lines start at positive char ges and
end at negative charges —they cannot form closed loops.
11.An electric dipole is a pair of equal and opposite charges q and – q
separated by some distance 2 a. Its dipole moment vector p  has
magnitude 2 qa and is in the direction o f the dipole axis from – q to q.

The 1/ r3 dependence of dipole electric fields should be noted in contrast
to the 1/ r2 dependence of electric field due to a point charge.
13.In a uniform electric field E, a dipole experiences a torque  τ given by
τ = p × E
but experiences no net force.
14.The flux Df of electric field E through a small area element DS is
given by
 Df  = E.DS
The vector area element DS is
DS = DS ˆn
where DS is the magnitude of the area element and ˆn is normal to the
area element, which can be considered planar for sufficiently small DS.
For an area element of a closed surface, ˆn is taken to be the direction
of outward  normal, by convention.
15.Gauss’s law : The flux of electric field through any closed surface S is
1/e0 times the total charge enclosed by S. The law is especially useful
in determining electric field E , when the source distribution has simple
symmetry:

The electric field outside the shell is as though the total charge is
concentrated at the centre. The same result is true for a solid sphere
of uniform volume charge density. The field is zero at all points inside
the shell.

POINTS TO PONDER
1.You might wonder why the pr otons, all carrying positive char ges,
are compactly residing inside the nucleus. Why do they not fly away?
You will lear n that ther e is a thir d kind of a fundamental for ce,
called the str ong for ce which holds them together . The range of
distance wher e this for ce is ef fective is, however , very small ~10-14
m. This is precisely the size of the nucleus. Also the electrons are
not allowed to sit on top of the protons, i.e. inside the nucleus,
due to the laws of quantum mechanics. This gives the atoms their
structure as they exist in na ture.
2.Coulomb force and gravitational force follow the same inverse-square
law. But gravitational force has only one sign (always attractive), while
Rationalised 2023-24
Electric Charges
and Fields
41Coulomb force can be of both signs (attractive and repulsive), allowing
possibility of cancellation of electric forces. This is how gravity, despite
being a much weaker force, can be a dominating and more pervasive
force in nature.
3.The constant of proportionality k in Coulomb’s law is a matter of
choice if the unit of charge is to be defined using Coulomb’s law. In SI
units, however , what is defined is the unit of curr ent (A) via its magnetic
effect (Ampere’s law) and the unit of charge (coulomb) is simply defined
by (1C = 1 A s). In this case, the value of k is no longer arbitrary; it is
approximately 9 × 109 N m2 C–2.
4.The rather large value of k, i.e., the large size of the unit of charge
(1C) from the point of view of electric effects arises because (as
mentioned in point 3 already) the unit of charge is defined in terms of
magnetic forces (forces on  current–carrying wires) which are generally
much weaker than the electric forces. Thus while 1 ampere is a unit
of reasonable size for magnetic effects, 1 C = 1 A s, is too big a unit for
electric effects.
5.The additive property of charge is not an ‘obvious’ property. It is related
to the fact that electric charge has no direction associated with it;
charge is a scalar .
6.Charge is not only a scalar (or invariant) under rotation; it is also
invariant for frames of reference in relative motion. This is not always
true for every scalar . For example, kinetic ener gy is a scalar under
rotation, but is not invariant for frames of reference in relative
motion.
7.Conservation of total charge of an isolated system is a property
independent of the scalar nature of charge noted in point 6.
Conservation refers to invariance in time in a given frame of reference.
A quantity may be scalar but not conserved (like kinetic energy in an
inelastic collision). On the other hand, one can have conserved vector
quantity (e.g., angular momentum of an isolated system).
8.Quantisation of electric charge is a basic (unexplained) law of nature;
interestingly, there is no analogous law on quantisation of mass.
9.Superposition principle should not be regarded as ‘obvious’, or
equated with the law of addition of vectors. It says two things:
force on one charge due to another charge is unaffected by the
presence of other charges, and there are no additional three-body,
four-body, etc., for ces which arise only when ther e are mor e than
two charges.
10.The electric field due to a discrete charge configuration is not defined
at the locations of the discrete charges. For continuous volume
charge distribution, it is defined at any point in the distribution.
For a surface charge distribution, electric field is discontinuous
across the surfac e.
11.The electric field due to a charge configuration with total charge zero
is not zero; but for distances large compared to the size of
the configuration, its field falls off faster than 1/ r2, typical of field
due to a single charge. An electric dipole is the simplest example of
this fa ct.
