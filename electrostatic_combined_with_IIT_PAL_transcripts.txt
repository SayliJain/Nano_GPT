ELECTRIC CHARGES
AND FIELDS
1.1  I NTRODUCTION
All of us have the experience of seeing a spark or hearing a crackle when
we take of f our synthetic clothes or sweater , particularly in dry weather .
Have you ever tried to find any explanation for this phenomenon? Another
common example of electric discharge is the lightning that we see in the
sky during thunderstor ms. W e also experience a sensation of an electric
shock either while opening the door of a car or holding the iron bar of a
bus after sliding from our seat. The reason for these experiences is
discharge of electric charges through our body, which were accumulated
due to rubbing of insulating sur faces. Y ou might have also hear d that
this is due to generation of static electricity. This is precisely the topic we
are going to discuss in this and the next chapter . Static means anything
that does not move or change with time. Electrostatics deals with
the study of forces, fields and potentials arising from
static charges .
1.2  E LECTRIC  CHARGE
Historically the credit of discovery of the fact that amber rubbed with
wool or silk cloth attracts light objects goes to Thales of Miletus, Greece,
around 600 BC. The name electricity is coined from the Greek word

elektr on meaning amber . Many such pairs of materials wer e known which
on rubbing could attract light objects like straw, pith balls and bits of
papers.
It was observed that if two glass rods rubbed with wool or silk cloth
are brought close to each other , they r epel each other [Fig. 1.1(a)]. The
two strands of wool or two pieces of silk cloth, with which the rods were
rubbed, also r epel each other . However , the glass r od and wool attracted
each other . Similarly, two plastic r ods rubbed with cat’s fur r epelled each
other [Fig. 1.1(b)] but attracted the fur . On the other hand, the plastic
rod attracts the glass rod [Fig. 1.1(c)] and repel the silk or wool with
which the glass r od is rubbed. The glass r od repels the fur .
These seemingly simple facts  were established from years of efforts
and careful experiments and their analyses. It was concluded, after many
careful studies by different scientists, that there were only two kinds of
an entry which is called the electric char ge. We say that the bodies like
glass or plastic rods, silk, fur and pith balls are electrified. They acquire
an electric charge on rubbing. T here are two kinds of electrification and
we find  that (i) like charges repel  and (ii) unlike charges  attract  each
other . The pr operty which dif ferentiates the two kinds of char ges is called
the polarity  of charge.
When a glass rod is rubbed with silk, the rod acquires one kind of
charge and the silk acquires the second kind of charge. This is true for
any pair of objects that are rubbed to be electrified. Now if the electrified
glass rod is brought in contact with silk, with which it was rubbed, they
no longer attract each other . They also do not attract or r epel other light
objects as they did on being electrified.
Thus, the charges acquired after rubbing are lost when the charged
bodies are brought in contact. What can you conclude from these
observations? It just tells us that unlike charges acquired by the objects
neutralise or nullify each other’s effect. Therefore, the charges were named
as positive  and negative  by the American scientist Benjamin Franklin.
By convention, the charge on glass rod or cat’s fur is called positive and
that on plastic rod or silk is termed negative. If an object possesses an
electric charge, it is said to be electrified or charged. When it has no charge
it is said to be electrically neutral.FIGURE  1.1 Rods: like char ges repel and unlike char ges attract each other .

Electric Charges
and Fields
3A simple apparatus to detect charge  on a body  is the gold-leaf
electroscope [Fig. 1.2(a)]. It consists of a vertical metal rod housed in a
box, with two thin gold leaves attached to its bottom end. When a charged
object touches the metal knob at the top of the rod, charge flows on to
the leaves and they diverge. The degree of divergance is an indicator of
the amount of charge.
Try to understand why material bodies acquir e char ge. You know that
all matter is made up of atoms and/or molecules. Although normally the
materials are electrically neutral,  they do contain charges; but their charges
are exactly balanced. For ces that hold the molecules together , forces that
hold atoms together in a solid, the adhesive force of glue, forces associated
with surface tension, all are basically electrical in nature, arising from the
forces between charged particles. Thus the electric force is all pervasive and
it encompasses almost each and every field associated with our life. It is
therefore essential that we learn more about such a force.
To electrify a neutral body, we need to add or remove one kind of
charge. When we say that a body is charged, we always refer to this
excess charge or deficit of charge. In solids,  some of the electrons, being
less tightly bound in the atom, are the charges which are transferred
from one body to the other .  A body can thus be char ged positively by
losing some of its electrons. Similarly, a body can be charged negatively
by gaining electrons. When we rub a glass rod with silk, some of the
electrons from the rod are transferred to the silk cloth. Thus the rod gets
positively charged and the silk gets negatively charged. No new charge is
created in the process of rubbing. Also the number of electrons, that are
transferred, is a very small fraction of the total number of electrons in the
material body.
1.3  C ONDUCTORS  AND INSULA TORS
Some substances readily allow passage of electricity through them, others
do not.  Those which allow electricity to pass through them easily are
called conductors . They have electric charges (electrons) that are
comparatively free to move inside the material. Metals, human and animal
bodies and earth are conductors. Most of the non-metals like glass,
porcelain, plastic, nylon, wood offer high resistance to the passage of
electricity through them. They are called insulators . Most  substances
fall into one of the two classes stated above *.
When some char ge is transferr ed to a conductor , it r eadily gets
distributed over the entir e sur face of the conductor . In contrast, if some
charge is put on an insulator , it stays at the same place. Y ou will lear n
why this happens in the next chapter .
This property of the materials tells you why a nylon or plastic comb
gets electrified on combing dry hair or on rubbing, but a metal article
*There is a third category called semiconductors , which offer resistance to the
movement of charges which is intermediate between the conductors and
insulators.

like spoon does not. The charges on metal leak through
our body to the ground as both are conductors of
electricity. However , if a metal r od with a wooden or plastic
handle is rubbed without touching its metal part, it shows
signs of charging.
1.4  B ASIC PROPERTIES  OF ELECTRIC
CHARGE
We have seen that ther e are two types of char ges, namely
positive and negative and their effects tend to cancel each
other . Here,  we shall now describe some other pr operties
of the electric charge.
If the sizes of charged bodies are very small as
compared to the distances between them, we treat them
as point charges . All the charge content of the body is
assumed to be concentrated at one point in space .
1.4.1  Additivity of charges
We have not as yet given a quantitative definition of a
charge; we shall follow it  up in the next section. W e shall
tentatively assume that this can be done and proceed. If
a system contains two point charges q1 and q2, the total
charge of the system is obtained simply by adding
algebraically q1 and q2 , i.e., charges add up like real numbers or they
are scalars like the mass of a body. If a system contains n charges q1,
q2, q3, …, qn, then the total charge of the system is q1 + q2 + q3 + … + qn
.  Char ge has  magnitude but no dir ection, similar to mass. However ,
there is one difference between mass and charge. Mass of a body is
always positive whereas a charge can be either positive or negative.
Proper signs have to be used while adding the charges in a system. For
example, the total charge of a system containing five charges +1, +2, –3,
+4 and –5, in some arbitrary unit, is (+1) + (+2) + (–3) + (+4) + (–5) = –1 i n
the same unit.
1.4.2  Charge is conserved
We have alr eady  hinted to the fact that when bodies ar e char ged by
rubbing, there is transfer of electrons from one body to the other; no new
charges are either created or destroyed. A picture of particles of electric
charge enables us to understand the idea of conservation of charge. When
we rub two bodies, what one body gains in charge the other body loses.
Within an isolated system consisting of many charged bodies, due to
interactions among the bodies, charges may get redistributed but it is
found that the total charge of the isolated system is always conserved .
Conservation of charge has been established experimentally.
It is not possible to create or destroy net charge carried by any isolated
system although the charge carrying particles may be created or destroyedFIGURE  1.2 Electroscopes: (a)

5in a process. Sometimes nature creates charged particles: a neutron turns
into a proton and an electron. The proton and electron thus create d have
equal and opposite charges and the total charge is zero before and after
the creation.
1.4.3  Quantisation of charge
Experimentally it is established that all free charges are integral multiples
of a basic unit of charge denoted by e. Thus charge q on a body is always
given by
q = ne
wher e n is any integer , positive or negative. This basic unit of char ge is
the charge that an electron or proton carries. By convention, the charge
on an electron is taken to be negative; therefore charge on an electron is
written as –e and that on a proton as +e.
The fact that electric charge is always an integral multiple of e  is termed
as quanti sation of charge . There are a large number of situations in physics
where certain physical quantities are quanti sed. The quanti sation of charge
was first suggested by the experimental laws of electrolysis discovered by
English experimentalist Faraday. It was experimentally demonstrated by
Millikan in 1912.
In the International System (SI) of Units, a unit of charge is called a
coulomb  and is denoted by the symbol C. A coulomb is defined in terms
the unit of the electric current which you are going to learn in a
subsequent chapter . In ter ms of this definition, one coulomb is the char ge
flowing through a wire in 1 s if the current is 1 A (ampere), (see Chapter 1
of Class XI, Physics Textbook , Part I). In this system, the value of the
basic unit of charge is
e = 1.602192 × 10–19 C
Thus, there are about 6 × 1018 electrons in a charge of  –1C. In
electrostatics, charges of this large magnitude are seldom  encountered
and hence we use smaller units 1 mC (micro coulomb) = 10–6 C or 1 mC
(milli coulomb) = 10–3 C.
If the protons and electrons are the only basic charges in the
universe, all the observable charges have to be integral multiples of e.
Thus, if a body contains n1 electrons and n2 protons, the total amount
of charge on the body is n2 × e + n1 × (–e) = (n2 – n1) e. Since n1 and n2
are integers, their dif ference is also an integer . Thus the char ge on any
body is always an integral multiple of e and can be increased or
decreased also in steps of e.
The step size e is, however , very small because at the macr oscopic
level, we deal with charges of a few mC. At this scale the fact that charge of
a body can increase or decrease in units of e is not visible. In this respect,
the grainy nature of the charge is lost and it appears to be continuous.
This situation can be compared with the geometrical concepts of points
and lines. A dotted line viewed from a distance appears continuous to
us but is not continuous in reality. As many points very close to
Rationalised 2023-24
6Physics
 EXAMPLE  1.2  EXAMPLE  1.1each other normally give an impression of a continuous line, many
small charges taken together appear as a continuous charge distribution.
At the macroscopic level, one deals with charges that are enormous
compared to the magnitude of charge e . Since e = 1.6 × 10–19 C, a charge
of magnituOde, say 1 mC, contains something like 1013 times the electronic
charge. At this scale, the fact that charge can increase or decrease only in
units of e is not very different from saying that charge can take continuous
values. Thus, at the macroscopic level, the quantisation of charge has no
practical consequence and can be ignor ed. However , at the micr oscopic
level, where the charges involved are of the order of a few tens or hundreds
of e, i.e.,  they can be counted, they appear in discrete lumps and
quantisation of charge cannot be ignored. It is the magnitude of scale
involved that is very important.
Example 1.1  If 109 electrons move out of a body to another body
every second, how much time is required to get a total charge of 1 C
on the other body?
Solution  In one second 109 electrons move out of the body. Therefore
the charge given out in one second is 1.6 × 10–19 × 109 C = 1.6 × 10–10 C.
The time required to accumulate a charge of 1 C can then be estimated
to be 1 C ÷ (1.6 × 10–10 C/s) = 6.25 × 109 s = 6.25 × 109 ÷ (365  × 24 ×
3600) years = 198 years. Thus to collect a charge of one coulomb,
from a body from which 109 electrons move out every second, we will
need approximately 200 years. One coulomb is, therefore, a very large
unit for many practical purposes.
It is, however , also important to know what is r oughly the number of
electrons contained in a piece of one cubic centimetre of a material.
A cubic piece of copper of side 1 cm contains about 2.5 × 1024
electrons.
Example 1.2 How much positive and negative charge is there in a
cup of water?
Solution  Let us assume that the mass of one cup of water is
250 g. The molecular mass of water is 18g. Thus, one mole
(= 6.02 × 1023 molecules) of water is 18 g. Therefore the number of
molecules in one cup of water is (250/18) × 6.02 × 1023.
Each molecule of water contains two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen
atom, i.e., 10 electrons and 10 protons. Hence the total positive and
total negative charge has the same magnitude. It is equal to
(250/18) × 6.02 × 1023 × 10 × 1.6 × 10–19 C = 1.3 4 × 107 C.
1.5  C OULOMB ’S LAW
Coulomb’s law is a quantitative statement about the force between two
point charges. When the linear size of charged bodies are much smaller
than the distance separating them, the size may be ignored and the
charged bodies are treated as point charges . Coulomb measured the
force between two point charges and found that it varied inversely as
the square of the distance between the charges and was directly
proportional to the product of the magnitude of the two charges and
Rationalised 2023-24

7acted along the line joining the two charges . Thus, if two
point charges q1, q2 are separated by a distance r in vacuum,
the magnitude of the force ( F) between them is given by
2 1
2q qF kr= (1.1)
How did Coulomb arrive at this law from his experiments?
Coulomb used a torsion balance *  for measuring the force
between two charged metallic spheres. When the separation
between two spheres is much larger than the radius of each
sphere, the charged spheres may be regarded as point charges.
However , the char ges on the spher es wer e unknown, to begin
with. How then could he discover a relation like Eq. (1.1)?
Coulomb thought of the following simple way: Suppose the
charge on a metallic sphere is q. If the sphere is put in contact
with an identical uncharged sphere, the charge will spread over
the two spheres. By symmetry, the charge on each sphere will
be q/2*. Repeating this process, we can get charges q/2, q/4,
etc. Coulomb varied the distance for a fixed pair of charges and
measured the force for different separations. He then varied the
charges in pairs, keeping the distance fixed for each pair .
Comparing forces for different pairs of  charges at different
distances, Coulomb arrived at the relation, Eq. (1.1).
Coulomb’s law, a simple mathematical statement,  was
initially experimentally arrived at  in the manner described
above. While the original experiments established it at a
macroscopic scale, it has also been established down to
subatomic level  ( r ~ 10–10 m).
Coulomb discovered his law without knowing the explicit
magnitude of the charge. In fact, it is the other way round:
Coulomb’s law can now be employed to furnish a definition
for a unit of charge. In the relation, Eq. (1.1), k is so far
arbitrary. W e can choose any positive value of k. The choice
of k determines the size of the unit of charge. In SI units, the
value of k is about 9 × 109 2
2Nm
C. The unit of charge that
results from this choice is called a coulomb which we defined
earlier in Section 1.4. Putting this value of k in Eq. (1.1), we
see that for q1 = q2 = 1 C, r = 1 m
F = 9 × 109 N
That is, 1 C is the charge that when placed at a distance
of 1 m from another charge of the same magnitude in vacuum
experiences an electrical force of repulsion of magnitude
*A torsion balance is a sensitive device to measure force. It was also used later
by Cavendish to measure the very feeble gravitational force between two objects,
to verify Newton’s Law of Gravitation.
*Implicit in this is the assumption of additivity of charges and conservation:
two charges ( q/2 each) add up to make a total charge  q.Charles Augustin de
Coulomb (1736 – 1806)
Coulomb, a French
physicist, began his
career as a military
engineer in the W est
Indies. In 1776, he
returned to Paris and
retired to a small estate
to do his scientific
research. He invented a
torsion balance to
measure the quantity of
a force and used it for
determination of forces
of electric attraction or
repulsion between small
charged spheres. He
thus arrived in 1785 at
the inverse square law
relation, now known as
Coulomb’s law. The law
had been anticipated by
Priestley and also by
Cavendish earlier ,
though Cavendish
never published his
results. Coulomb also
found the inverse
square law of force
between unlike and like
magnetic poles.

be used. In practice, in electrostatics, one uses
smaller units like 1 mC or 1 mC.
The constant k in Eq. (1.1) is usually put as
k = 1/4 pe0 for later convenience, so that Coulomb’s

Since for ce is a vector , it is better to write
Coulomb’s law in the vector notation. Let the position
vectors of charges q1 and q2 be r1 and r2 respectively
[see Fig.1.3(a)]. W e denote for ce on q1 due to q2 by
F12 and force on q2 due to q1 by F21. The two point
charges q1 and q2 have been numbered 1 and 2 for
convenience and the vector leading from 1 to 2 is
denoted by r21:
r21 = r2 – r1
In the same way, the vector leading from 2 to 1 is denoted by r12:
r12 = r1 – r2 = – r21
The magnitude of the vectors r21 and r12 is denoted by r21 and r12,
respectively ( r12 = r21). The direction of a vector is specified by a unit
vector along the vector . To denote the dir ection fr om 1 to 2 (or fr om 2 to
1), we define the unit vectors:

Some remarks on Eq. (1.3) are relevant:
·Equation (1.3) is valid for any sign of q1 and q2 whether positive or
negative. If q1 and q2 are of the same sign (either both positive or both
negative), F21 is along  ˆr21, which denotes repulsion, as it should be for
like charges. If q1 and q2 are of opposite signs, F21 is along –ɵr21(=ɵr12),
which denotes attraction, as expected for unlike charges. Thus, we do
not have to write separate equations for the cases of like and unlike
charges. Equation (1.3) takes care of both cases correctly [Fig. 1. 3(b)].FIGURE  1.3 (a) Geometry and

·Coulomb’s law [Eq. (1.3)] gives the force between two charges q1 and
q2 in vacuum. If the charges are placed in matter or the intervening
space has matter , the situation gets complicated due to the pr esence
of char ged constituents of matter . We shall consider electr ostatics in
matter in the next chapter .

However , it may be mentioned her e that the signs of the two for ces

of these forces between two protons inside a nucleus (distance
between two protons is ~ 10-15 m inside a nucleus) are Fe ~ 230 N,
whereas, FG ~ 1.9 × 10–34 N.

forces are enormously stronger than the gravitational forces.

Comparing this with the value of acceleration due to gravity, we

the motion of electron and it undergoes very large accelerations

deflection of its shadow on a screen). Spheres A and B are touched
by uncharged spheres C and D respectively, as shown in Fig. 1.4(b).
C and D are then removed and B is brought closer to A to a
distance of 5.0 cm between their centres, as shown in Fig. 1.4(c).
What is the expected repulsion of A on the basis of Coulomb’s law?
Spheres A and C and spheres B and D have identical sizes. Ignore
the sizes of A and B in comparison to the separation between their

q¢. At a distance r between their centres, the magnitude of the

identical but uncharged sphere C touches A, the charges redistribute
on A and C and, by symmetry, each sphere carries a charge q/2.

q¢/2. Now, if the separation between A and B is halved, the magnitude

1.6  F ORCES  BETWEEN  MULTIPLE C HARGES
The mutual electric force between two charges is given by
Coulomb’s law. How to calculate the force on a charge where
there are not one but several charges around? Consider a
system of n stationary charges q1, q2, q3, ..., qn in vacuum.
What is the force on q1 due to q2, q3, ..., qn? Coulomb’s law is
not enough to answer this question.  Recall that forces of
mechanical origin add according to the parallelogram law of
addition. Is the same true for forces of electrostatic origin?
Experimentally, it is verified that force on any charge  due
to a number of other charges is the vector sum of all the forces
on that charge due to the  other charges, taken one at a time.
The individual forces are unaffected due to the presence of
other charges . This is termed as the principle of superposition .
To better understand the concept, consider a system of
three charges q1, q2 and q3, as shown in Fig. 1.5(a) . The force
on one charge, say q1, due to two other charges q2, q3 can
therefore be obtained by performing a vector addition of the
forces due to each one of these charges. Thus, if the force on q1

The above calculation of force can be generalised to a system of
charges more than three, as shown in Fig. 1.5(b).
The principle of superposition says that in a system of charges q1,
q2, ..., qn, the force on q1 due to q2 is the same as given by Coulomb’s law,
i.e., it is unaffected by the presence of the other charges q3, q4, ..., qn. The
total force F1 on the charge q1, due to all other charges, is then given by
the vector sum of the forces F12, F13, ...,  F1n:

about O.
Example 1.6 Consider the charges q, q, and – q placed at the vertices
of an equilateral triangle, as shown in Fig. 1.7. What is the force on
each charge?
FIGURE  1.7
Solution   The forces acting on charge q at A due to charges q at B
and –q at C are F12 along BA and F13 along AC respectively, as shown
in Fig. 1.7. By the parallelogram law, the total force F1 on the charge
q at A is given by
F1 = F 1ˆr where 1ˆr is a unit vector along BC.
The force of attraction or repulsion for each pair of charges has the

It is interesting to see that the sum of the forces on the three charges
is zero, i.e.,
F1 + F2 + F3 = 0
The result is not at all surprising. It follows straight from the fact
that Coulomb’s law is consistent with Newton’s third law. The proof
is left to you as an exercise.
1.7  E LECTRIC  FIELD
Let us consider a point charge Q placed in vacuum, at the origin O. If we
place another point char ge q at a point P , wher e OP = r, then the char ge Q
will exert a for ce on q as per Coulomb’s law. W e may ask the question: If
charge q is removed, then what is left in the surrounding? Is there
nothing? If ther e is nothing at the point P , then how does a for ce act
when we place the char ge q at P. In or der to answer such questions, the
early scientists introduced the concept of field. According to this, we say
that the charge Q produces an electric field everywhere in the surrounding.
When another char ge q is brought at some point P , the field ther e acts on
it and produces a force. The electric field produced by the charge Q  at a
point r is given as
E r r r ()= =1
41
402
02π πε εQ
rQ
rˆ ˆ(1.6)
where ˆ=r r/r, is a unit vector fr om the origin to the point r. Thus, Eq.(1.6)
specifies the value of the electric field for each value of the position
vector r. The wor d “field” signifies how some distributed quantity (which
could be a scalar or a vector) varies with position. The effect of the charge
has been incorporated in the existence of the electric field. W e obtain the
force F exerted by a charge  Q on a charge q, as
F r =1
402πεQq
rˆ(1.7)
Note that the charge q also exerts an equal and opposite force on the
charge Q. The electrostatic force between the charges Q and q can be
looked upon as an interaction between charge q and the electric field of
Q and vice versa. If we denote the position of char ge q by the vector r, it
experiences a force F equal to the charge q multiplied by the electric
field E at the location of q. Thus,
F(r) = q E(r) (1.8)
Equation (1.8) defines the SI unit of electric field as N/C *.
Some important remarks may be made here:
(i)From Eq. (1.8), we can infer that if q is unity, the electric field due to
a charge Q is numerically equal to the force exerted by it. Thus, the
electric field due to a charge  Q at a point in space may be defined
as the force that a unit positive charge would experience if placed

15at that point . The charge Q, which is producing the electric field, is
called a source charge  and the charge q, which tests the effect of a
source charge, is called a test charge . Note that the source charge Q
must r emain at its original location. However , if a char ge q is brought
at any point around  Q, Q itself is bound to experience an electrical
force due to q and will tend to move. A way out of this difficulty is to
make q negligibly small. The force F is then negligibly small but the
ratio F/q is finite and defines the electric field:
EF=

→lim
q q0(1.9)
A practical way to get around the problem (of keeping Q undisturbed
in the presence of q) is to hold Q to its location by unspecified forces!
This may look strange but actually this is what happens in practice.
When we are considering the electric force on a test charge q due to a
charged planar sheet (Section 1.14), the charges on the sheet are held to
their locations by the forces due to the unspecified charged constituents
inside the sheet.
(ii)Note that the electric field E due to Q, though defined operationally in
terms of some test charge q, is independent of q. This is because
F is proportional to q, so the ratio F/q does not depend on q. The
force F on the charge q due to the charge Q depends on the particular
location of charge q which may take any value in the space around
the charge Q. Thus, the electric field E due to Q is also dependent on
the space coor dinate r. For dif ferent positions of the char ge q all over
the space , we get different values of electric field E. The field exists at
every point in three-dimensional space.
(iii)For a positive charge, the electric field will be directed radially
outwards from the charge. On the other hand, if the source charge is
negative, the electric field vector , at each point, points radially inwar ds.
(iv)Since the magnitude of the force F on charge q due to charge Q
depends only on the distance r of the charge q from charge Q,
the magnitude of the electric field E will also depend only on the
distance r. Thus at equal distances fr om the char ge Q, the magnitude
of its electric field E is same.  The magnitude of electric field E due to
a point charge is thus same on a sphere with the point charge at its
centre; in other words, it has a spherical symmetry.
1.7.1  Electric field due to a system of charges
Consider a system of charges q1, q2, ..., qn with  position vectors r1,
r2, ..., rn relative  to some origin O. Like the electric field at a point in
space due to a single charge, electric field at a point in space due to the
system of charges is defined to be the force experienced by a unit
test charge placed at that point, without disturbing the original
positions of char ges 
q1, q2, ..., qn. We can use Coulomb’s law and the
superposition principle to determine this field at a point P denoted by
position vector r.

1.7.2  Physical significance of electric field
You may wonder why the notion of electric field has been intr oduced
here at all. After all, for any system of charges, the measurable quantity
is the force on a charge which can be directly determined using Coulomb’s
law and the superposition principle [Eq. (1.5)]. Why then introduce this
intermediate quantity called the electric field?
For electrostatics, the concept of electric field is convenient, but not
really necessary. Electric field is an elegant way of characterising the
electrical environment of a system of charges. Electric field at a point in
the space around a system of charges tells you the force a unit positive
test charge would experience if placed at that point (without disturbing
the system). Electric field is a characteristic of the system of charges and
is independent of the test charge that you place at a point to determine
the field. The term field in physics generally refers to a quantity that is
defined at every point in space and may vary from point to point. Electric
field is a vector field, since force is a vector quantity.
The true physical significance of the concept of electric field, however ,
emerges only when we go beyond electrostatics and deal with time-
dependent electromagnetic phenomena. Suppose we consider the force
between two distant charges q1, q2 in accelerated motion. Now the greatest
speed with which a signal or information can go from one point to another
is c, the speed of light. Thus, the effect of any motion of q1 on q2 cannotFIGURE  1.9 Electric field at a point

vector sum of the electric fields at
the point due to individual charges.

17arise instantaneously. There will be some time delay between the effect
(force on q2) and the cause (motion of q1). It is precisely here that the
notion of electric field (strictly, electromagnetic field) is natural and very
useful. The field picture is this: the accelerated motion of charge q1
produces electromagnetic waves, which then propagate with the speed
c, reach q2 and cause a force on q2. The notion of field elegantly accounts
for the time delay. Thus, even though electric and magnetic fields can be
detected only by their effects (forces) on charges, they are regarded as
physical entities, not merely mathematical constructs. They have an
independent dynamics of their own,  i.e., they evolve according to laws
of their own. They can also transport energy. Thus, a source of time-
dependent electromagnetic fields, turned on for a short interval of time
and then switched off, leaves behind propagating electromagnetic fields
transporting energy. The concept of field was first introduced by Faraday
and is now among the central concepts in physics.
Example 1.7 An electron falls through a distance of 1.5 cm in a
uniform electric field of magnitude 2.0 × 104 N C–1 [Fig. 1.10(a)]. The
direction of the field is reversed keeping its magnitude unchanged
and a proton falls through the same distance [Fig. 1.10(b)]. Compute
the time of fall in each case. Contrast the situation with that of ‘free
fall under gravity’.
FIGURE  1.10
Solution In Fig. 1.10(a) the field is upward, so the negatively charged
electron experiences a downward force of magnitude eE where E is
the magnitude of the electric field. The acceleration of the electron is
ae  =  eE/me
where me is the mass of the electron.
Starting from rest, the time required by the electron to fall through a
distance h is given by  2 2

For e = 1.6 × 10–19C, me = 9.11 × 10–31 kg,
     E = 2.0 × 104 N C–1, h = 1.5 × 10–2 m,
  te = 2.9 × 10–9s
In Fig. 1.10 (b), the field is downward, and the positively charged
proton experiences a downward force of magnitude eE. The
acceleration of the proton is
ap  =  eE/mp
where mp is the mass of the proton; mp = 1.67 × 10–27 kg. The time of
fall for the proton is EXAMPLE  1.7

Thus, the heavier particle (proton) takes a greater time to fall through
the same distance. This is in basic contrast to the situation of ‘free
fall under gravity’ where the time of fall is independent of the mass of
the body. Note that in this example we have ignored the acceleration
due to gravity in calculating the time of fall. To see if this is justified,
let us calculate the acceleration of the proton in the given electric
field:

which is enormous compared to the value of g (9.8 m s–2), the
acceleration due to gravity. The acceleration of the electron is even
greater . Thus, the ef fect of acceleration due to gravity can be ignor ed
in this example.

1.8  E LECTRIC F IELD LINES
We have studied electric field in the last section. It is a vector quantity
and can be represented as we represent vectors. Let us try to represent E
due to a point charge pictorially. Let the point charge be placed at the
origin. Draw vectors pointing along the direction of the
electric field with their lengths proportional to the strength
of the field at each point. Since the magnitude of electric
field at a point decreases inversely as the square of the
distance of that point from the charge, the vector gets
shorter as one goes away from the origin, always pointing
radially outward. Figure 1.12 shows such a picture.  In
this figure, each arrow indicates the electric field, i.e., the
force acting on a unit positive charge, placed at the tail of
that arrow.  Connect the arrows pointing in one direction
and the r esulting figur e represents a field line. W e thus
get many field lines, all pointing outwards from the point
charge. Have we lost the information about the strength
or magnitude of the field now, because it was contained
in the length of the arrow? No. Now the magnitude of the
field is represented by the density of field lines. E is strong
near the charge, so the density of field lines is more near
the char ge and the lines ar e closer . Away fr om the char ge,
the field gets weaker and the density of field lines is less,
resulting in well-separated lines.
Another person may draw more lines. But the number of lines is not
important. In fact, an infinite number of lines can be drawn in any region.FIGURE  1.12 Field of a point charge. EXAMPLE  1.8
Rationalised 2023-24
20Physics
It is the relative density of lines in different regions which is
important.
We draw the figur e on the plane of paper , i.e., in two-
dimensions but we live in three-dimensions. So if one wishes
to estimate the density of field lines, one has to consider the
number of lines per unit cross-sectional area, perpendicular
to the lines.  Since the electric field decreases as the square of
the distance from a point charge and the area enclosing the
charge increases as the square of the distance, the number
of field lines crossing the enclosing area remains constant,
whatever may be the distance of the area from the charge.
We started by saying that the field lines carry infor mation
about the direction of electric field at different points in space.
Having drawn a certain set of field lines, the relative density
(i.e., closeness) of the field lines at different points indicates
the relative strength of electric field at those points. The field
lines crowd where the field is strong and are spaced apart
wher e it is weak. Figur e 1.13 shows a set of field lines. W e
can imagine two equal and small elements of area placed at points R and
S normal to the field lines there. The number of field lines in our picture
cutting the area elements is proportional to the magnitude of field at
these points. The picture shows that the field at R is stronger than at S.
To understand the dependence of the field lines on the area, or rather
the solid angle subtended by an area element, let us try to relate the
area with the solid angle, a generalisation of angle to three dimensions.
Recall how a (plane) angle is defined in two-dimensions. Let a small
transverse line element Dl  be placed at a distance r from a point O. Then
the angle subtended by D
l  at O can be appr oximated as Dq = Dl/r.
Likewise, in three-dimensions the solid angle * subtended by a small
perpendicular plane ar ea DS, at a distance r, can be written as
DW = DS/r2. We know that in a given solid angle the number of radial
field lines is the same. In Fig. 1.13, for two points P1 and P2 at distances
r1 and r2 from the charge, the element of area subtending the solid angle
DW is 2
1rDW at P1 and an element of area 2
2rDW at P2, respectively. The
number of lines (say n) cutting these area elements are the same. The
number of field lines, cutting unit area element is therefore n/(2
1rDW) at
P1 and n/(2
2rDW) at P2, respectively. Since n and DW are common, the
strength of the field clearly has a 1/ r2 dependence.
The picture of field lines was invented by Faraday to develop an
intuitive non-mathematical way of visualising electric fields around
charged configurations. Faraday called them lines of for ce. This ter m is
somewhat misleading, especially in case of magnetic fields. The more
appr opriate ter m is field lines  (electric or magnetic) that we have
adopted in this book.
Electric field lines are thus a way of pictorially mapping the electric
field around a configuration of charges. An electric field line is, in general,FIGURE  1.13  Dependence of
electric field strength on the
distance and its relation to the
number of field lines.
*Solid angle is a measure of a cone. Consider the intersection of the given cone
with a sphere of radius R. The solid angle DW of the cone is defined to be equal
to DS/R2, where DS is the area on the sphere cut out by the cone.

21a curve drawn in such a way that the tangent to it at each
point is in the direction of the net field at that point. An
arrow on the curve is obviously necessary to specify the
direction of electric field from the two possible directions
indicated by a tangent to the curve. A field line is a space
curve, i.e., a curve in three dimensions.
Figure 1.14 shows the field lines around some simple
charge configurations. As mentioned earlier , the field lines
are in 3-dimensional space, though the figure shows them
only in a plane. The field lines of a single positive charge
are radially outward while those of a single negative
charge are radially inward. The field lines around a system
of two positive charges ( q, q) give a vivid pictorial
description of their mutual repulsion, while those around
the configuration of two equal and opposite charges
(q, –q), a dipole, show clearly the mutual attraction
between the charges. The field lines follow some important
general properties:
(i)Field lines start from positive charges and end at
negative charges. If there is a single charge, they may
start or end at infinity.
(ii)In a charge-free region, electric field lines can be taken
to be continuous curves without any breaks.
(iii)Two field lines can never cr oss each other . (If they did,
the field at the point of intersection will not have a
unique direction, which is absurd.)
(iv)Electrostatic field lines do not form any closed loops.
This follows from the conservative nature of electric
field (Chapter 2).
1.9  E LECTRIC  FLUX
Consider flow of a liquid with velocity v, through a small
flat surface d S, in a direction normal to the surface. The
rate of flow of liquid is given by the volume crossing the
area per unit time  v dS and represents the flux of liquid
flowing across the plane. If the normal to the surface is
not parallel to the direction of flow of liquid, i.e., to v , but
makes an angle q with it, the projected area in a plane
perpendicular to v is δdS cos q. Therefore, the flux going
out of the surface d S is v.ˆndS. For the case of  the electric
field, we define an analogous quantity and call it electric
flux. We should, however , note that ther e is no flow of a
physically observable quantity unlike the case of
liquid flow.
In the picture of electric field lines described above,
we saw that the number of field lines crossing a unit area,
placed normal to the field at a point is a measure of the
strength of electric field at that point. This means that ifFIGURE  1.14 Field lines due to
some simple charge configurations.
Rationalised 2023-24
22Physics
we place a small planar element of area DS
normal to E at a point, the number of field lines
crossing it is proportional * to E DS. Now
suppose we tilt the area element by angle q.
Clearly, the number of field lines crossing the
area element will be smaller . The pr ojection of
the area element normal to E is DS cos q. Thus,
the number of field lines crossing DS is
proportional to E DS cos q. When q = 90°, field
lines will be parallel to DS and will not cross it
at all (Fig. 1.15).
The orientation of area element and not
merely its magnitude is important in many
contexts. For example, in a stream, the amount
of water flowing through a ring will naturally
depend on how you hold the ring. If you hold
it normal to the flow, maximum water will flow
through it than if you hold it with some other
orientation. This shows that an area element
should be tr eated as a vector . It has a
magnitude and also a direction. How to specify the direction of a planar
area? Clearly, the normal to the plane specifies the orientation of the
plane. Thus the direction of a planar area vector is along its normal.
How to associate a vector to the ar ea of a curved sur face? W e imagine
dividing the surface into a large number of very small area elements.
Each small area element may be treated as planar and a vector associated
with it, as explained before.
Notice one ambiguity here. The direction of an area element is along
its normal. But a normal can point in two directions. Which direction do
we choose as the direction of the vector associated with the area element?
This problem is resolved by some convention appropriate to the given
context. For the case of a closed surface, this convention is very simple.
The vector associated with every area element of a closed surface is taken
to be in the direction of the outward  normal. This is the convention used
in Fig. 1.16. Thus, the area element vector DS at a point on a closed
surface equals DS ˆn where D S is the magnitude of the area element and
ˆn is a unit vector in the direction of outward normal at that point.
We now come to the definition of electric flux. Electric flux Df through
an area element DS is defined by
Df = E.DS = E DS  cos q (1.11)
which, as seen before, is proportional to the number of field lines cutting
the area element. The angle q here is the angle between E and DS. For a
closed surface, with the convention stated already, q is the angle between
E and the outward normal   to the area element. Notice we could look at
the expression E DS cos q  in two ways:  E ( DS cos q ) i.e., E times theFIGURE  1.15  Dependence of flux on the
inclination q between E and ˆn.

ˆn and DS. *It will not be proper to say that the number of field lines is equal to E DS. The
number of field lines is after all, a matter of how many field lines we choose to
draw. What is physically significant is the relative number of field lines crossing
a given area at different points.

23projection of area normal to E,  or E^ DS, i.e., component of E along the
normal to the area element times the magnitude of the area element. The
unit of electric flux is N C–1 m2.
The basic definition of electric flux given by Eq. (1.11) can be used, in
principle, to calculate the total flux through any given surface. All we
have to do is to divide the surface into small area elements, calculate the
flux at each element and add them up. Thus, the total flux f through a
surface S is
f ~ S E.DS (1.12)
The approximation sign is put because the electric field E is taken to
be constant over the small area element. This is mathematically exact
only when you take the limit DS ® 0  and the sum in Eq. (1.12) is written
as an integral.
1.10  E LECTRIC  DIPOLE
An electric dipole is a pair of equal and opposite point charges q and – q,
separated by a distance 2 a. The line connecting the two charges defines
a direction in space. By convention, the direction from – q to q is said to
be the direction of the dipole. The mid-point of locations of – q and q is
called the centre of the dipole.
The total charge of the electric dipole is obviously zero. This does not
mean that the field of the electric dipole is zero. Since the charge q and
–q are separated by some distance, the electric fields due to them, when
added, do not exactly cancel out. However , at distances much lar ger than
the separation of the two charges forming a dipole ( r >> 2 a), the fields
due to q and – q nearly cancel out. The electric field due to a dipole
therefore falls off, at large distance, faster than like 1/ r2 (the dependence
on r of the field due to a single charge q). These qualitative ideas are
borne out by the explicit calculation as follows:
1.10.1  The field of an electric dipole
The electric field of the pair of charges (– q 
and q) at any point in space
can be found out from Coulomb’s law and the superposition principle.
The results are simple for the following two cases: (i) when the point is on
the dipole axis, and (ii) when it is in the equatorial plane  of the dipole,
i.e.,  on a plane perpendicular to the dipole axis through its centre.  The
electric field at any general point P is obtained by adding the electric
fields E–q due to the charge – q and E+q due to the charge q, by the
parallelogram law of vectors.
(i) For points on the axis
Let the point P be at distance r from the centre of the dipole on the side of
the charge q,  as shown in Fig. 1.17(a). Then

The directions of  E+q and E–q are as shown in
Fig. 1.17(b). Clearly, the components normal to the dipole
axis cancel away. The components along the dipole axis
add up. The total electric field is opposite to ˆp. We have

From Eqs. (1.15) and (1.18), it is clear that the dipole field at large
distances does not involve q and a separately; it depends on the product
qa. This suggests the definition of dipole moment. The dipole moment
vector  p of an electric dipole is defined by
p  = q × 2a ˆp (1.19)
that is, it is a vector whose magnitude is charge q times the separation
2a (between the pair of charges q, –q) and the direction is along the line
from – q to q. In terms of p, the electric field of a dipole at large distances
takes simple forms:

 EXAMPLE  1.9 Notice the important point that the dipole field at large distances
falls of f not as 1/ r2 but as1/ r3. Further ,  the magnitude and the dir ection
of the dipole field depends not only on the distance r but also on the
angle  between the position vector r and the dipole moment p.
We can think of the limit when the dipole size 2 a appr oaches zer o,
the charge q approaches infinity in such a way that the product
p = q × 2a is finite. Such a dipole is referred to as a point dipole . For a
point dipole, Eqs. (1.20) and (1.21) ar e exact, true for any r.
1.10.2  Physical significance of dipoles
In most molecules, the centres of positive charges and of negative charges *
lie at the same place. Therefore, their dipole moment is zero. CO2 and
CH4 are of this type of molecules. However , they develop a dipole moment
when an electric field is applied. But in some molecules, the centres of
negative charges and of positive charges do not coincide. Therefore they
have a permanent electric dipole moment, even in the absence of an electric
field. Such molecules are called polar molecules. W ater molecules, H2O,
is an example of this type. V arious materials give rise to inter esting
properties and important applications in the presence or  absence of
electric field.
Example 1.9 Two charges ±10 mC are placed 5.0 mm apart. Determine
the electric field at (a) a point P on the axis of the dipole 15 cm away
from its centre O on the side of the positive charge, as shown in Fig.
1.18(a), and (b) a point Q, 15 cm away from O on a line passing through
O and normal to the axis of the dipole, as shown in Fig. 1.18(b).

The resultant electric field at P due to the two charges at A and B is

In this example, the ratio OP/OB is quite large (= 60). Thus, we can

the for mula for electric field at a far -away point on the axis of a dipole.

1.11  D IPOLE IN A UNIFORM  EXTERNAL  FIELD
Consider a permanent dipole of dipole moment p in a uniform
external field E, as shown in Fig. 1.19. (By permanent dipole, we
mean that p exists  irrespective of E; it has not been induced by E.)
There is a force qE on q and a force – qE on – q. The net force on
the dipole is zer o, since E is unifor m. However , the char ges ar e
separated, so the forces act at different points, resulting in a torque
on the dipole. When the net force is zero, the torque (couple) is
independent of the origin. Its magnitude equals the magnitude of
each force multiplied by the arm of the couple (perpendicular
distance between the two antiparallel forces).
Magnitude of torque = q E × 2 a sinq
       = 2 q a E  sinq
Its dir ection is nor mal to the plane of the paper , coming out of it.
The magnitude of p × E is also p E sinq and its direction
is nor mal to the paper , coming out of it. Thus,
t tt tt  = p × E (1.22)
This torque will tend to align the dipole with the field
E. When p is aligned with E, the torque is zero.
What happens if the field is not uniform? In that case,
the net force will evidently be non-zero. In addition there
will, in general, be a torque on the system as before. The
general case is involved, so let us consider the simpler
situations when p is parallel to E or antiparallel to E. In
either case, the net torque is zero, but there is a net force
on the dipole if E is not uniform.
Figure 1.20 is self-explanatory. It is easily seen that
when p is parallel to E, the dipole has a net force in the
direction of increasing field. When p is antiparallel to E,
the net force on the dipole is in the direction of decreasing
field. In general, the force depends on the orientation of p
with respect to E.
This brings us to a common observation in frictional
electricity. A comb run through dry hair attracts pieces of
paper . The comb, as we know, acquir es char ge thr ough
friction. But the paper is not charged. What then explains
the attractive force? Taking the clue from the precedingFIGURE  1.19 Dipole in a
uniform electric field.

dipole: (a) E parallel to p, (b)  E
antiparallel to p.

28Physics
discussion, the char ged comb ‘polarises’ the piece of paper , i.e., induces
a net dipole moment in the dir ection of field. Further , the electric field
due to the comb is not uniform. This non-uniformity of the field makes a
dipole to experience a net force on it. In this situation, it is easily seen
that the paper should move in the direction of the comb!
1.12  C ONTINUOUS  CHARGE  DISTRIBUTION
We have so far dealt with char ge configurations involving discr ete char ges
q1, q2, ..., qn. One reason why we restricted to discrete charges is that the
mathematical treatment is simpler and does not involve calculus. For
many purposes, however , it is impractical to work in ter ms of discr ete
charges and we need to work with continuous charge distributions. For
example, on the sur face of a char ged conductor , it is impractical to specify
the charge distribution in terms of the locations of the microscopic charged
constituents. It is more feasible to consider an area element DS (Fig. 1.21)
on the surface of the conductor (which is very small on the macroscopic
scale but big enough to include a very large number of electrons) and
specify the char ge DQ on that element. W e then define a surface char ge
density  s at the area element by
Q
SσΔ=Δ(1.23)
We can do this at dif ferent points on the conductor and thus arrive at
a continuous function s, called the surface charge density. The surface
charge density s  so defined ignores the quantisation of charge and the
discontinuity in charge distribution at the microscopic level *. s  represents
macroscopic surface charge density, which in a sense, is a smoothed out
average of the microscopic charge density over an area element DS which,
as said before, is large microscopically but small macroscopically. The
units for s are C/m2.
Similar considerations apply for a line charge distribution and a volume
charge distribution. The linear charge density  l of a wire is defined by
Q
lλΔ=Δ(1.24)
where Dl is a small line element of wire on the macroscopic scale that,
however , includes a lar ge number of micr oscopic char ged constituents,
and DQ is the charge contained in that line element. The units for l are
C/m. The volume charge density  (sometimes simply called charge density)
is defined in a similar manner:
Q
VρΔ=Δ(1.25)
where DQ is the charge included in the macroscopically small volume
element DV that includes a large number of microscopic charged
constituents. The units for r are C/m3.
The notion of continuous charge distribution is similar to that we
adopt for continuous mass distribution in mechanics. When we refer toFIGURE  1.21
Definition of linear ,
surface and volume
charge densities.
In each case, the
element ( Dl, DS, DV)
chosen is small on
the macroscopic
scale but contains
a very large number
of microscopic
constituents.
*At the microscopic level, charge distribution is discontinuous, because they are
discrete charges separated by intervening space where there is no charge.

29the density of a liquid, we are referring to its macroscopic density. We
regard it as a continuous fluid and ignore its discrete molecular
constitution.
The field due to a continuous charge distribution can be obtained in
much the same way as for a system of discrete charges, Eq. (1.10). Suppose
a continuous char ge distribution in space has a char ge density r. Choose
any convenient origin O and let the position vector of any point in the
charge distribution be r. The char ge density r may vary fr om point to
point, i.e., it is a function of r. Divide the char ge distribution into small
volume elements of size DV. The char ge in a volume element DV is rDV.
Now, consider any general point P (inside or outside the distribution)
with position vector R (Fig. 1.21). Electric field due to the charge rDV is
given by Coulomb’s law:
2
01ˆ
4V'r'ρ
εΔΔ =πE r (1.26)
wher e r¢ is the distance between the char ge element and P , and  ˆr¢ is a
unit vector in the dir ection fr om the char ge element to P . By the
superposition principle, the total electric field due to the charge
distribution is obtained by summing over electric fields due to different
volume elements:
2
01ˆ
4all VV'r'ρ
εΔΔ≅ ΣπE r (1.27)
Note that r, r¢,  ˆ′r all can vary fr om point to point. In a strict
mathematical method, we should let DV®0 and the sum then becomes
an integral; but we omit that discussion here, for simplicity. In short,
using Coulomb’s law and the superposition principle, electric field can
be determined for any charge distribution, discrete or continuous or part
discrete and part continuous.
1.13  G AUSS’S LAW
As a simple application of the notion of electric flux, let us consider the
total flux thr ough a spher e of radius r, which encloses a point char ge q
at its centre. Divide the sphere into small area elements, as shown in
Fig. 1.22.
The flux through an area element DS is
2
0ˆ
4q
rφεΔ = Δ = ΔπE S r Sii (1.28)
where we have used Coulomb’s law for the electric field due to a single
charge q. The unit vector ˆr is along the radius vector from the centre to
the area element. Now, since the normal to a sphere at every point is
along the radius vector at that point, the area element DS and ˆr  have
the same direction. Therefore,
2
04qSrφεΔ = Δπ(1.29)
since the magnitude of a unit vector is 1.
The total flux through the sphere is obtained by adding up flux
through all the different area elements:FIGURE  1.22  Flux

Equation (1.30) is a simple illustration of a general result of
electrostatics called Gauss’s law.
We state Gauss’s law  without pr oof:
Electric flux through a closed surface S
= q/ e0(1.31)
q = total charge enclosed by S.
The law implies that the total electric flux through a closed surface is
zero if no char ge is enclosed by the sur face. W e can see that explicitly in
the simple situation of Fig. 1.23.
Here the electric field is uniform and we are considering a closed
cylindrical surface, with its axis parallel to the uniform field E . The total
flux f  through the surface is  f = f1 + f2 + f3, where f1 and f2 represent
the flux through the surfaces 1 and 2 (of circular cross-section) of the
cylinder and f3 is the flux through the curved cylindrical part of the
closed surface. Now the normal to the surface 3 at every point is
perpendicular to E, so by definition of flux,  f3 = 0. Further , the outwar d
normal to 2 is along E while the outward normal to 1 is opposite to E.
Therefore,
f1 = –E S1,     f2 = +E S2
S1 = S2 = S
where  S is the area of circular cross-section. Thus, the total flux is zero,
as expected by Gauss’s law. Thus, whenever you find that the net electric
flux through a closed surface is zero, we conclude that the total charge
contained in the closed surface is zero.
The great significance of Gauss’s law Eq. (1.31), is that it is true in
general, and not only for the simple cases we have considered above. Let
us note some important points regarding this law:
(i)Gauss’s law is true for any closed surface, no matter what its shape
or size.
(ii)The term q on the right side of Gauss’s law, Eq. (1.31), includes the
sum of all charges enclosed by the surface. The charges may be located
anywhere inside the surface.
(iii)In the situation when the surface is so chosen that there are some
charges inside and some outside, the electric field [whose flux appears
on the left side of Eq. (1.31)] is due to all the charges, both inside and
outside S. The ter m q on the right side of Gauss’s law, however ,
represents only the total charge inside S.

 EXAMPLE  1.10(iv)The surface that we choose for the application of Gauss’s law is called
the Gaussian sur face. Y ou may choose any Gaussian sur face and
apply Gauss’s law. However , take car e not to let the Gaussian sur face
pass through any discrete charge. This is because electric field due
to a system of discrete charges is not well defined at the location of
any charge. (As you go close to the charge, the field grows without
any bound.) However , the Gaussian sur face can pass thr ough a
continuous charge distribution.
(v)Gauss’s law is often useful towards a much easier calculation of the
electrostatic field when the system has some symmetry.  This is
facilitated by the choice of a suitable Gaussian surface.
(vi) Finally, Gauss’s law is based on the inverse square dependence on
distance contained in the Coulomb’s law. Any violation of Gauss’s
law will indicate departure from the inverse square law.
Example 1.10  The electric field components in Fig. 1.24 are
Ex = ax1/2, Ey = Ez = 0, in which a = 800 N/C m1/2. Calculate (a) the
flux through the cube, and (b) the charge within the cube. Assume
that a = 0.1 m.
FIGURE  1.24
Solution
(a)Since the electric field has only an x component, for faces
perpendicular to x direction, the angle between E and DS is
± p/2. Therefore, the flux  f = E.DS is separately zero for each face
of the cube except the two shaded ones. Now the magnitude of
the electric field at the left face is
EL = ax1/2 = aa1/2
(x = a at the left face).
The magnitude of electric field at the right face is
ER = a x1/2 = a (2a)1/2
(x = 2a at the right face).
The corresponding fluxes are

(b) W e can use Gauss’s law to find the total char ge q inside the cube.

  q = 1.05 × 8.854 × 10–12 C = 9.27 × 10–12 C.
Example 1.11  An electric field is uniform, and in the positive x
direction for positive x, and uniform with the same magnitude but in
the negative x direction for negative x. It is given that E = 200 ˆi  N/C
for x > 0 and E = –200 ˆi N/C for x < 0. A right circular cylinder of
length 20 cm and radius 5 cm has its centre at the origin and its axis
along the x-axis so that one face is at x = +10 cm and the other is at
x = –10 cm (Fig. 1.25). (a) What is the net outward flux through each
flat face? (b) What is the flux through the side of the cylinder?
(c) What is the net outward flux through the cylinder? (d) What is the
net charge inside the cylinder?
Solution
(a)We can see fr om the figur e that on the left face E and DS are
parallel. Therefore, the outward flux is
fL= E.DS = – 200 ˆΔi Si
=  + 200 DS, since  ˆΔi Si= – DS

331.14  A PPLICA TIONS OF GAUSS’S LAW
The electric field due to a general charge distribution is, as seen above,
given by Eq. (1.27). In practice, except for some special cases, the
summation (or integration) involved in this equation cannot be carried
out to give electric field at every point in
space. For some symmetric charge
configurations, however , it is possible to
obtain the electric field in a simple way using
the Gauss’s law. This is best understood by
some examples.
1.14.1 Field due to an infinitely
long straight uniformly
charged wire
Consider an infinitely long thin straight wire
with uniform linear charge density l. The wire
is obviously an axis of symmetry. Suppose we
take the radial vector from O to P and rotate it
around the wir e. The points P , P¢, P¢¢ so
obtained are completely equivalent with
respect to the charged wire. This implies that
the electric field must have the same magnitude
at these points. The direction of electric field at
every point must be radial (outward if l > 0,
inward if l < 0). This is clear from Fig. 1.2 6.
Consider a pair of line elements P1 and P2
of the wire, as shown. The electric fields
produced by the two elements of the pair when
summed give a resultant electric field which
is radial (the components normal to the radial
vector cancel). This is true for any such pair
and hence the total field at any point P is
radial. Finally, since the wire is infinite,
electric field does not depend on the position
of P along the length of the wire. In short, the
electric field is everywhere radial in the plane
cutting the wire normally, and its magnitude
depends only on the radial distance r.
To calculate the field, imagine a cylindrical
Gaussian surface, as shown in the Fig. 1.2 6(b).
Since the field is everywhere radial, flux
through the two ends of the cylindrical
Gaussian surface is zero. At the cylindrical
part of the surface, E is normal to the surface
at every point, and its magnitude is constant,
since it depends only on r. The surface ar ea
of the curved part is  2 prl, where l is the length
of the cylinder .FIGURE 1.26 (a) Electric field due to an
infinitely long thin straight wire is radial,

34Physics
Flux through the Gaussian surface
=flux through the curved cylindrical part of the surface
=E × 2prl
The surface includes charge equal to l l. Gauss’s law then gives
E × 2prl = ll/e0
i.e.,E  = 
02rλ
επ
Vectorially, E at any point is given by
0ˆ
2rλ
ε=πE n (1.32)
where ˆn is the radial unit vector in the plane normal to the wire passing
through the point. E is directed outward if l is positive and inward if l is
negative.
Note that when we write a vector A as a scalar multiplied by a unit
vector , i.e., as A = A ˆa, the scalar A is  an algebraic number . It can be
negative or positive. The direction of A will be the same as that of the unit
vector ˆaif A > 0 and opposite to ˆa if A < 0. When we want to restrict to
non-negative values, we use the symbol Aand call it the modulus of A.
Thus, 0≥A .
Also note that though only  the charge enclosed by the surface ( ll)
was included above, the electric field E is due to the charge on the entire
wire. Further , the assumption that the wir e is infinitely long is crucial.
Without this assumption, we cannot take E to be normal to the curved
part of the cylindrical Gaussian sur face. However , Eq. (1.32) is
approximately true for electric field around the central portions of a long
wire, where the end effects may be ignored.
1.14.2  Field due to a uniformly charged infinite plane sheet
Let s be the uniform surface charge density of an infinite plane sheet
(Fig. 1.27). W e take the x-axis nor mal to the given plane. By symmetry,
the electric field will not depend on y and z coordinates and its direction
at every point must be parallel to the x-direction.
We can take the Gaussian sur face to be a
rectangular parallelepiped of cross-sectional area
A, as shown. (A cylindrical surface will also do.) As
seen from the figure, only the two faces 1 and 2 will
contribute to the flux; electric field lines are parallel
to the other faces and they, therefore, do not
contribute to the total flux.
The unit vector normal to surface 1 is in – x
direction while  the unit  vector normal to surface 2
is in the + x direction. Therefore, flux  E.DS through
both the surfaces are equal and add up. Therefore
the net flux through the Gaussian surface is 2 EA.
The charge enclosed by the closed surface is sA.
Therefore by Gauss’s law,FIGURE  1.27  Gaussian surface for a
uniformly charged infinite plane sheet.

or,  E = s/2e0
Vectorically,

ε=E n (1.33)
where ˆn is a unit vector normal to the plane and going away from it.
E is directed away from the plate if s  is positive and toward the plate
if s is negative. Note that the above application of the Gauss’ law has
brought out an additional fact: E is independent of x also.
For a finite large planar sheet, Eq. (1.33) is approximately true in the
middle regions of the planar sheet, away from the ends.
1.14.3   Field due to a uniformly charged thin spherical shell
Let s be the uniform surface charge density of a thin spherical shell of
radius R (Fig. 1.28). The situation has obvious spherical symmetry. The
field at any point P , outside or inside, can depend only on r (the radial
distance from the centre of the shell to the point) and must be radial (i.e.,
along the radius vector).
(i)Field outside the shell:  Consider a point P outside the
shell with radius vector r. To calculate E at P, we take the
Gaussian surface to be a sphere of radius r and with centre
O, passing thr ough P . All points on this spher e are equivalent
relative to the given charged configuration. (That is what we
mean by spherical symmetry.) The electric field at each point
of the Gaussian surface, therefore, has the same magnitude
E and is along the radius vector at each point. Thus, E and
DS at every point are parallel and the flux through each
element is E DS. Summing over all DS, the flux through the
Gaussian surface is E × 4 p r2. The charge enclosed is
s × 4 p R2. By Gauss’s law
E × 4 p r2 = 2
04Rσ

Or,  2

where q  =  4 p R2 s is the total charge on the spherical shell.
Vectorially,
2
0ˆ
4q
rε=πE r (1.34)
The electric field is directed outward if q > 0 and inward if
q < 0. This, however , is exactly the field pr oduced by a char ge
q placed at the centre O. Thus for points outside the shell, the field due
to a uniformly charged shell is as if  the entire charge of the shell is
concentrated at its centre.
(ii)Field inside the shell:  In Fig. 1.28(b), the point P is inside the
shell. The Gaussian surface is again a sphere through P centred at O.FIGURE  1.28  Gaussian
surfaces for a point with

 EXAMPLE  1.12The flux through the Gaussian surface, calculated as before, is
E × 4 p r2. However , in this case, the Gaussian sur face encloses no
charge. Gauss’s law then gives
E × 4 p r2 =  0
i.e., E = 0          ( r < R ) (1.35)
that is, the field due to a uniformly charged thin shell is zero at all points
inside the shell *. This important result is a direct consequence of Gauss’s
law which follows from Coulomb’s law. The experimental verification of
this result confirms the 1/ r2 dependence in Coulomb’s law.
Example 1.12 An early model for an atom considered it to have a
positively charged point nucleus of charge Ze, surrounded by a
uniform density of negative charge up to a radius R. The atom as a
whole is neutral. For this model, what is the electric field at a distance
r from the nucleus?
FIGURE  1.29
Solution   The charge distribution for this model of the atom is as
shown in Fig. 1.29. The total negative charge in the uniform spherical
charge distribution of radius R must be – Z e, since the atom (nucleus
of charge Z e + negative charge) is neutral. This immediately gives us
the negative char ge density r, since we must have
340–3RZeρπ=
or 33
4Ze
Rρ=−π
To find the electric field E(r) at a point P which is a distance r away
from the nucleus, we use Gauss’s law. Because of the spherical
symmetry of the charge distribution, the magnitude of the electric
field E(r) depends only on the radial distance, no matter what the
direction of r. Its dir ection is along (or opposite to) the radius vector r
from the origin to the point P . The obvious Gaussian sur face is a
spherical sur face centr ed at the nucleus. W e consider two situations,
namely, r < R and r > R.
(i) r < R : The electric flux f enclosed by the spherical surface is
    f  =  E (r) × 4 p r2

 EXAMPLE  1.12wher e E (r)  is the magnitude of the electric field at r. This is because
the field at any point on the spherical Gaussian surface has the
same direction as the normal to the surface there,  and has the same
magnitude at all points on the surface.
The charge q enclosed by the Gaussian surface is the positive nuclear
charge and the negative char ge within the spher e of radius r,

The electric field is directed radially outward.
(ii) r > R:  In this case, the total charge enclosed by the Gaussian
spherical surface is zero since the atom is neutral. Thus, from Gauss’s
law,
E (r) × 4 p  r2 = 0  or  E (r) = 0;    r > R
At r = R, both cases give the same result: E = 0.
SUMMARY
1.Electric and magnetic forces determine the properties of atoms,
molecules and bulk matter .
2.From simple experiments on frictional electricity, one can infer that
there are two types of charges in nature; and that like charges repel
and unlike charges attract. By convention, the charge on a glass rod
rubbed with silk is positive; that on a plastic rod rubbed with fur is
then negative.
3.Conductors allow movement of electric charge through them,
insulators do not. In metals, the mobile charges are electrons; in
electrolytes both positive and negative ions are mobile.
4.Electric charge has three basic properties: quantisation, additivity
and conservation.
Quantisation of electric charge means that total charge ( q) of a body
is always an integral multiple of a basic quantum of charge ( e) i.e.,
q = n e, where n = 0, ±1, ±2, ±3, .... Proton and electron have charges
+e, –e, respectively. For macroscopic charges for which n is a very large
number , quantisation of char ge can be ignor ed.
Additivity of electric charges means that the total charge of a system
is the algebraic sum (i.e., the sum taking into account proper signs)
of all individual charges in the system.
Conservation of electric charges means that the total charge of an
isolated system remains unchanged with time. This means that when
Rationalised 2023-24
38Physics
bodies are charged through friction, there is a transfer of electric charge
from one body to another , but no cr eation or destruction
of charge.
5.Coulomb’s Law : The mutual electrostatic force between two point
charges q1 and q2 is proportional to the product q1q2 and inversely
proportional to the square of the distance r21 separating them.
Mathematically,
F21 = force on q2 due to  1 2
1 21 2
21ˆk (q q )qr= r
where 21ˆr is a unit vector in the direction from q1 to q2 and k =  
01
4επ
is the constant of proportionality.
In SI units, the unit of charge is coulomb. The experimental value of
the constant e0 is
e0 = 8.854 × 10–12 C2 N–1 m–2
The approximate value of k is
k = 9 × 109 N m2 C–2
6.The ratio of electric force and gravitational force between a proton
and an electron is

e pk e.G m m≅ ×
7.Superposition Principle : The principle is based on the property that the
forces with which two charges attract or repel each other are not
affected by the presence of a third (or more) additional charge(s). For
an assembly of charges q1, q2, q3, ..., the force on any charge, say q1, is
the vector sum of the force on  q1 due to q2, the force on  q1 due to q3,
and so on. For each pair , the for ce is given by the Coulomb’s law for
two char ges stated earlier .
8.The electric field E at a point due to a charge configuration is the
force on a small positive test charge q placed at the point divided by
the magnitude of the charge. Electric field due to a point charge q has
a magnitude | q|/4pe0r2; it is radially outwards from q, if q is positive,
and radially inwards if q is negative. Like Coulomb force, electric field
also satisfies superposition principle.
9.An electric field line is a curve drawn in such a way that the tangent
at each point on the curve gives the direction of electric field at that
point. The relative closeness of field lines indicates the relative strength
of electric field at different points; they crowd near each other in regions
of strong electric field and are far apart where the electric field is
weak. In regions of constant electric field, the field lines are uniformly
spaced parallel straight lines.
10.Some of the important properties of field lines are: (i) Field lines are
continuous curves without any breaks. (ii) Two field lines cannot cross
each other . (iii) Electr ostatic field lines start at positive char ges and
end at negative charges —they cannot form closed loops.
11.An electric dipole is a pair of equal and opposite charges q and – q
separated by some distance 2 a. Its dipole moment vector p  has
magnitude 2 qa and is in the direction o f the dipole axis from – q to q.

13.In a uniform electric field E, a dipole experiences a torque  τ given by
τ = p × E
but experiences no net force.
14.The flux Df of electric field E through a small area element DS is
given by
 Df  = E.DS
The vector area element DS is
DS = DS ˆn
where DS is the magnitude of the area element and ˆn is normal to the
area element, which can be considered planar for sufficiently small DS.
For an area element of a closed surface, ˆn is taken to be the direction
of outward  normal, by convention.
15.Gauss’s law : The flux of electric field through any closed surface S is
1/e0 times the total charge enclosed by S. The law is especially useful
in determining electric field E , when the source distribution has simple
symmetry:

The electric field outside the shell is as though the total charge is

of uniform volume charge density. The field is zero at all points inside
the shell.

POINTS TO PONDER
1.You might wonder why the pr otons, all carrying positive char ges,
are compactly residing inside the nucleus. Why do they not fly away?
You will lear n that ther e is a thir d kind of a fundamental for ce,
called the str ong for ce which holds them together . The range of
distance wher e this for ce is ef fective is, however , very small ~10-14
m. This is precisely the size of the nucleus. Also the electrons are
not allowed to sit on top of the protons, i.e. inside the nucleus,
due to the laws of quantum mechanics. This gives the atoms their
structure as they exist in na ture.
2.Coulomb force and gravitational force follow the same inverse-square
law. But gravitational force has only one sign (always attractive), while
Rationalised 2023-24
Electric Charges
and Fields
41Coulomb force can be of both signs (attractive and repulsive), allowing
possibility of cancellation of electric forces. This is how gravity, despite
being a much weaker force, can be a dominating and more pervasive
force in nature.
3.The constant of proportionality k in Coulomb’s law is a matter of
choice if the unit of charge is to be defined using Coulomb’s law. In SI
units, however , what is defined is the unit of curr ent (A) via its magnetic
effect (Ampere’s law) and the unit of charge (coulomb) is simply defined
by (1C = 1 A s). In this case, the value of k is no longer arbitrary; it is
approximately 9 × 109 N m2 C–2.
4.The rather large value of k, i.e., the large size of the unit of charge
(1C) from the point of view of electric effects arises because (as
mentioned in point 3 already) the unit of charge is defined in terms of
magnetic forces (forces on  current–carrying wires) which are generally
much weaker than the electric forces. Thus while 1 ampere is a unit
of reasonable size for magnetic effects, 1 C = 1 A s, is too big a unit for
electric effects.
5.The additive property of charge is not an ‘obvious’ property. It is related
to the fact that electric charge has no direction associated with it;
charge is a scalar .
6.Charge is not only a scalar (or invariant) under rotation; it is also
invariant for frames of reference in relative motion. This is not always
true for every scalar . For example, kinetic ener gy is a scalar under
rotation, but is not invariant for frames of reference in relative
motion.
7.Conservation of total charge of an isolated system is a property
independent of the scalar nature of charge noted in point 6.
Conservation refers to invariance in time in a given frame of reference.
A quantity may be scalar but not conserved (like kinetic energy in an
inelastic collision). On the other hand, one can have conserved vector
quantity (e.g., angular momentum of an isolated system).
8.Quantisation of electric charge is a basic (unexplained) law of nature;
interestingly, there is no analogous law on quantisation of mass.
9.Superposition principle should not be regarded as ‘obvious’, or
equated with the law of addition of vectors. It says two things:
force on one charge due to another charge is unaffected by the
presence of other charges, and there are no additional three-body,
four-body, etc., for ces which arise only when ther e are mor e than
two charges.
10.The electric field due to a discrete charge configuration is not defined
at the locations of the discrete charges. For continuous volume
charge distribution, it is defined at any point in the distribution.
For a surface charge distribution, electric field is discontinuous
across the surfac e.
11.The electric field due to a charge configuration with total charge zero
is not zero; but for distances large compared to the size of
the configuration, its field falls off faster than 1/ r2, typical of field
due to a single charge. An electric dipole is the simplest example of
this fa ct.

2.1  I NTRODUCTION
In Chapters 6 and 8 (Class XI), the notion of potential energy was
introduced. When an external force does work in taking a body from a
point to another against a force like spring force or gravitational force,
that work gets stored as potential energy of the body. When the external
force is removed, the body moves, gaining kinetic energy and losing
an equal amount of potential energy. The sum of kinetic and
potential energies is thus conserved. Forces of this kind are called
conservative forces. Spring force and gravitational force are examples of
conservative forces.
Coulomb force between two (stationary) charges is also a conservative
force. This is not surprising, since both have inverse-square dependence
on distance and differ mainly in the proportionality constants – the
masses in the gravitational law are replaced by charges in Coulomb’s
law. Thus, like the potential energy of a mass in a gravitational
field, we can define electrostatic potential energy of a charge in an
electrostatic field.
Consider an electrostatic field  E due to some charge configuration.
First, for simplicity, consider the field E due to a charge Q placed at the
origin. Now, imagine that we bring a test charge q from a point R to a
point P against the repulsive force on it due to the charge Q. With referenceChapter Two

46to Fig. 2.1, this will happen if Q and q are both positive
or both negative. For definiteness, let us take Q, q > 0.
Two remarks may be made here. First, we assume
that the test charge q is so small that it does not disturb
the original configuration, namely the charge Q at the
origin (or else, we keep Q fixed at the origin by some
unspecified force). Second, in bringing the charge q from
R to P , we apply an exter nal for ce Fext just enough to
counter the repulsive electric force FE (i.e, Fext= –FE).
This means there is no net force on or acceleration of
the char ge q when it is br ought fr om R to P , i.e., it is
brought with infinitesimally slow constant speed. In
this situation, work done by the external force is the negative of the work
done by the electric force, and gets fully stored in the form of potential
energy of the char ge q. If the exter nal for ce is r emoved on r eaching P, the
electric force will take the charge away from Q – the stored energy (potential
energy) at P is used to provide kinetic energy to the charge q in such a
way that the sum of the kinetic and potential energies is conserved.
Thus, work done by external forces in moving a charge q from R to P is
WRP =   
        =    –  (2.1)
This work done is against electrostatic repulsive force and gets stored
as potential energy.
At every point in electric field, a particle with charge q possesses a
certain electrostatic potential energy, this work done increases its potential
energy by an amount equal to potential energy difference between points
R and P .
Thus, potential energy difference
P R RP U U U WΔ = − = (2.2)
(Note here that this displacement is in an opposite sense to the electric
force and hence work done by electric field is negative, i.e. , –WRP.)
Therefore, we can define electric potential energy difference between
two points as the work required to be done by an external force in moving
(without acceleratin g) charge q from one point to another for electric field
of any arbitrary charge configuration.
Two important comments may be made at this stage:
(i)The right side of Eq. (2.2) depends only on the initial and final positions
of the charge. It means that the work done by an electrostatic field in
moving a charge from one point to another depends only on the initial
and the final points and is independent of the path taken to go from
one point to the other . This is the fundamental characteristic of a
conservative force. The concept of the potential energy would not be
meaningful if the work depended on the path. The path-independence
of work done by an electrostatic field can be proved using the
Coulomb’s law. W e omit this pr oof her e.FIGURE  2.1 A test charge q (> 0) is

47(ii)Equation (2.2) defines potential energy difference  in terms
of the physically meaningful quantity work . Clearly,
potential energy so defined is undetermined to within an
additive constant.What this means is that the actual value
of potential energy is not physically significant; it is only
the dif ference of potential ener gy that is significant. W e can
always add an arbitrary constant a to potential energy at
every point, since this will not change the potential energy
difference:
( ) ( )P R P R U U U Uα α+ − + = −
Put it differently, there is a freedom in choosing the point
where potential energy is zero. A convenient choice is to have
electrostatic potential energy zero at infinity. With this choice,
if we take the point R at infinity, we get from Eq. (2.2)
P P P W U U U∞ ∞ = − = (2.3)
Since the point P is arbitrary, Eq. (2.3) provides us with a
definition of potential energy of a charge q at any point.
Potential energy of charge q at a point (in the presence of field
due to any charge configuration)  is the work done by the
exter nal for ce (equal and opposite to the electric for ce) in
bringing the charge q from infinity to that point .
2.2  E LECTROST ATIC POTENTIAL
Consider any general static char ge configuration. W e define
potential energy of a test charge q in terms of the work done
on the charge q. This work is obviously proportional to q , since
the force at any point is qE, where E is the electric field at that
point due to the given charge configuration. It is, therefore,
convenient to divide the work by the amount of charge q, so
that the resulting quantity is independent of q . In other words,
work done per unit test charge is characteristic of the electric
field associated with the charge configuration. This leads to
the idea of electrostatic potential V due to a given charge
configuration. From Eq. (2.1), we get:

Note, as before, that it is not the actual value of potential but the potential
difference that is physically significant. If, as before, we choose the
potential to be zero at infinity, Eq. (2.4) implies:

48In other words, the electrostatic potential ( V)
at any point in a region with electrostatic field is
the work done in bringing a unit positive
charge (without acceleration) from infinity to
that point.
The qualifying remarks made earlier regarding
potential energy also apply to the definition of
potential. To obtain the work done per unit test
charge, we should take an infinitesimal test charge
dq, obtain the work done dW in bringing it from
infinity to the point and determine the ratio
dW/dq. Also, the external force at every point of the
path is to be equal and opposite to the electrostatic
force on the test charge at that point.
2.3  P OTENTIAL DUE TO A POINT CHARGE
Consider a point charge Q at the origin (Fig. 2.3). For definiteness, take Q
to be positive. W e wish to deter mine the potential at any point P with
position vector r from the origin. For that we must
calculate the work done in bringing a unit positive
test char ge from infinity to the point P . For Q > 0,
the work done against the repulsive force on the
test charge is positive. Since work done is
independent of the path, we choose a convenient
path – along the radial direction from infinity to
the point P .
At some intermediate point P ¢ on the path, the
electrostatic force on a unit positive charge is

 EXAMPLE  2.1Equation (2.8) is true for any
sign of the charge Q, though we
considered Q > 0 in its derivation.
For Q < 0, V < 0, i.e., work done (by
the external force) per unit positive
test charge in bringing it from
infinity to the point is negative. This
is equivalent to saying that work
done by the electrostatic force in
bringing the unit positive charge
form infinity to the point P is
positive. [This is as it should be,
since for Q < 0, the force on a unit
positive test charge is attractive, so
that the electrostatic force and the
displacement (from infinity to P) are
in the same direction.] Finally, we
note that Eq. (2.8) is consistent with
the choice that potential at infinity
be zero.
Figure (2.4) shows how the electrostatic potential ( 1/r) and the
electr ostatic field ( 1/r2 ) varies with r.

(b)Hence obtain the work done in bringing a charge of 2 × 10–9 C

along which the charge is brought?

(b)W = qV =  2 × 10–9C × 4 × 104V

No, work done will be path independent. Any arbitrary infinitesimal
path can be resolved into two perpendicular displacements: One along
r and another perpendicular to  r. The work done corresponding to
the later will be zero.
2.4  P OTENTIAL DUE TO
 AN ELECTRIC  DIPOLE
As we lear nt in the last chapter , an electric dipole consists of two char ges
q and  – q separated by a (small) distance 2 a. Its total charge is zero. It is
characterised by a dipole moment vector p whose magnitude is q × 2a
and which points in the dir ection fr om –q to q (Fig. 2.5). W e also saw that
the electric field of a dipole at a point with position vector r depends not
just on the magnitude r, but also on the angle between r and p. Further ,FIGURE  2.4 Variation of potential V with r [in units of
(Q/4pe0) m-1] (blue curve) and field with r [in units

50the field falls off, at large distance, not as
1/r2 (typical of field due to a single charge)
but as 1/ r3. We, now, deter mine the electric
potential due to a dipole and contrast it
with the potential due to a single charge.
As before, we take the origin at the
centre of the dipole. Now we know that the
electric field obeys the superposition
principle. Since potential is related to the
work done by the field, electrostatic
potential also follows the superposition
principle. Thus, the potential due to the
dipole is the sum of potentials due to the
charges q and – q

(Positive sign for q = 0, negative sign for q = p.) The potential in the
equatorial plane ( q = p/2) is zero.
The important contrasting features of electric potential of a dipole
from that due to a single charge are clear from Eqs. (2.8) and (2.15):
(i)The potential due to a dipole depends not just on r but also on the
angle between the position vector  r and the dipole moment vector p.
(It is, however , axially symmetric about p. That is, if you r otate the
position vector r  about  p, keeping q fixed, the points corresponding
to P on the cone so generated will have the same potential as at P .)
(ii)The electric dipole potential falls off, at large distance, as 1/ r2, not as
1/r, characteristic of the potential due to a single char ge. (You can
refer to the Fig. 2.5 for graphs of 1/ r2 versus r and 1/ r versus r,
drawn there in another context.)

such contributions, and thus determine the potential due to the entire

We have seen in Chapter 1 that for a unifor mly char ged spherical shell,
the electric field outside the shell is as if the entire charge is concentrated

where q is the total charge on the shell and R its radius. The electric field
inside the shell is zero. This implies (Section 2.6) that potential is constant

and, therefore, equals its value at the surface, which is

(b)A small negative charge will be attracted towards positive charge.
The negative charge moves from higher potential energy to lower

of a small negative charge between Q and P is positive.
Similarly, (P .E.)A > (P .E.)B and hence sign of potential ener gy

(c)In moving a small positive charge fr om Q to P , work has to be

work done by the field is negative.
(d)In moving a small negative charge from B to A work has to be

54FIGURE  2.10 Equipotential surfaces for a uniform electric field.2.6  E QUIPOTENTIAL  SURFACES
An equipotential surface is a surface with a constant value of potential
at all points on the surface. For a single charge q, the potential is given
by Eq. (2.8):
1
4oqVrε=π
This shows that V is a constant if r is constant. Thus, equipotential
surfaces of a single point charge are concentric spherical surfaces centred
at the charge.
Now the electric field lines for a single charge q are radial lines starting
from or ending at the charge, depending on whether q is positive or negative.
Clearly, the electric field at every point is normal to the equipotential surface
passing through that point. This is true in general: for any charge
configuration , equipotential sur face thr ough a point is nor mal to the
electric field at that point . The proof of this statement is simple.
If the field were not normal to the equipotential surface, it would
have non-zero component along the surface. To move a unit test charge
against the direction of the component of the field, work would have to
be done. But this is in contradiction to the definition of an equipotential
surface: there is no potential difference between any two points on the
surface and no work is required to move a test charge on the surface.
The electric field must, therefore, be normal to the equipotential surface
at every point. Equipotential surfaces offer an alternative visual picture
in addition to the picture of electric field lines around a charge
configuration.FIGURE  2.9 For a

For a uniform electric field E, say, along the x-axis, the equipotential
surfaces are planes normal to the x-axis, i.e., planes parallel to the y-z
plane (Fig. 2.10). Equipotential surfaces for (a) a dipole and (b) two

Consider two closely spaced equipotential surfaces A and B (Fig. 2.12)
with potential values V and V + d V, where d V is the change in V in the
direction of the electric field E. Let P be a point on the
surface B. d l is the perpendicular distance of the
surface A fr om P. Imagine that a unit positive char ge
is moved along this perpendicular from the surface B
to surface A against the electric field. The work done
in this process is | E|d l.
This work equals the potential difference
VA–VB.
Thus,
|E|d l = V – (V + dV)= – dV
i.e., |E|=−δ

We thus arrive at two important conclusions concer ning the r elation

(i)Electric field is in the direction in which the potential decreases
steepest.
(ii)Its magnitude is given by the change in the magnitude of potential
per unit displacement nor mal to the equipotential sur face at the point.
2.7  P OTENTIAL E NERGY OF A SYSTEM  OF CHARGES
Consider first the simple case of two charges q1and q2 with position vector
r1 and r2 relative to some origin. Let us calculate the work done
(externally) in building up this configuration. This means that we consider
the charges q1 and q2 initially at infinity and determine the work done by
an external agency to bring the charges to the given locations. Suppose,
first the charge q1 is brought from infinity to the point r1. There is no
external field against which work needs to be done, so work done in
bringing q1 from infinity to r1 is zero. This charge produces a potential in
space given by
Vq
r1
01
11
4=πεP
where r1P is the distance of a point P in space from the location of q1.
From the definition of potential, work done in bringing charge q2 from
infinity to the point r2 is q2 times the potential at r2 due to q1:
work done on q2 = 1

More generally, the potential energy expression,
Eq. (2.22), is unaltered whatever way the charges are brought to the specified
locations, because of path -independence of work for electrostatic force.
Equation (2.22) is true for any sign of  q1and q2. If q1q2 > 0, potential
energy is positive. This is as expected, since for like charges ( q1q2 > 0),
electrostatic force is repulsive and a positive amount of work is needed to
be done against this force to bring the charges from infinity to a finite
distance apart. For unlike charges ( q1 q2 < 0), the electrostatic force is
attractive. In that case, a positive amount of work is needed against this
force to take the charges from the given location to infinity. In other words,
a negative amount of work is needed for the reverse path (from infinity to
the present locations), so the potential energy is negative.
Equation (2.22) is easily generalised for a system of any number of
point charges. Let us calculate the potential energy of a system of three
charges q1, q2 and q3 located at r1, r2, r3, respectively. To bring q1 first
from infinity to r1, no work is required. Next we bring q2 from infinity to
r2. As before, work done in this step is

–q are brought to B, C and D, respectively. The total work needed can
be calculated in steps:

E is clearly zero since potential due to A and C is cancelled by that
due to B and D. Hence, no work is required to bring any charge to
point E.
2.8  P OTENTIAL E NERGY IN AN EXTERNAL F IELD
2.8.1  Potential energy of a single charge
In Section 2.7, the source of the electric field was specified – the charges
and their locations - and the potential energy of the system of those charges
was  determined. In this section, we ask a related but a distinct question.
What is the potential energy of a charge q in a given field? This question
was, in fact, the starting point that led us to the notion of the electrostatic
potential (Sections 2.1 and 2.2). But here we address this question again
to clarify in what way it is different from the discussion in Section 2.7.
The main difference is that we are now concerned with the potential
energy of a char ge (or char ges) in an exter nal field. The exter nal field E is
not produced by the given charge(s) whose potential energy we wish to
calculate.  E is produced by sources external to the given charge(s).The
external sources may be known, but often they are unknown or
unspecified; what is specified is the electric field E or the electrostatic
potential V due to the exter nal sour ces. W e assume that the char ge q
does not significantly affect the sources producing the external field. This
is true if q is very small, or the external sources are held fixed by other
unspecified forces. Even if q is finite, its influence on the external sources
may still be ignored in the situation when very strong sources far away
at infinity produce a finite field E in the region of interest. Note again that
we are interested in determining the potential energy of a given charge 
q
(and later , a system of char ges) in the exter nal field; we ar e not inter ested
in the potential energy of the sources producing the external electric field.
The external electric field E and the corresponding external potential
V may vary from point to point. By definition, V at a point P is the work
done in bringing a unit positive char ge from infinity to the point P .

59
 EXAMPLE  2.5(We continue to take potential at infinity to be zer o.) Thus, work done in
bringing a char ge q from infinity to the point P in the exter nal field is q V.
This work is stored in the form of potential energy of q . If the point P has
position vector r relative to some origin, we can write:
Potential energy of q at r in an external field
= qV(r) (2.27)
where V(r) is the exter nal potential at the point r.
Thus, if an electron with charge q = e = 1.6×10–19 C is accelerated by
a potential difference of DV = 1 volt, it would gain energy of qDV = 1.6  ×
10–19J. This unit of energy is defined as 1 electron volt  or 1eV, i.e.,
1 eV=1.6 × 10–19J. The units based on eV are most commonly used in
atomic, nuclear and particle physics, (1 keV = 103eV = 1.6  × 10–16J, 1 MeV
= 106eV = 1.6  × 10–13J, 1 GeV = 109eV = 1.6  × 10–10J and 1 TeV = 1012eV
= 1.6 × 10–7J). [This has already been defined on Page 117, XI Physics
Part I, Table 6.1.]
2.8.2 Potential energy of a system of two charges in an
external field
Next, we ask: what is the potential energy of a system of two charges q1
and q2 located at r1and r2, respectively, in an external field? First, we
calculate the work done in bringing the charge q1 from infinity to r1.
Work done in this step is q1 V(r1), using Eq. (2.27). Next, we consider the
work done in bringing q2 to r2. In this step, work is done not only against
the external field E but also against the field due to q1.
Work done on q2 against the exter nal field

wher e  r12 is the distance between q1 and q2. We have made use of Eqs.

the work done on q2 against the two fields ( E and that due to q1):

2.8.3  Potential energy of a dipole in an external field
Consider a dipole with charges q1 = +q and q2 = –q placed in a uniform
electric field E, as shown in Fig. 2.16.
As seen in the last chapter, in a uniform electric field,
the dipole experiences no net force; but experiences a
torque t t t t t given by
t = t = t = t = t = p × E (2.30)
which will tend to rotate it (unless p is parallel or
antiparallel to E). Suppose an external torque ttt
ttext is
applied in such a manner that it just neutralises this
torque and rotates it in the plane of paper from angle q0
to angle q1 at an infinitesimal angular speed and without
angular acceleration.  The amount of work done by the
external torque will be given by
( ) cos cospEθ θ0 1 = − (2.31)
This work is stored as the potential energy of the system. We can
then associate potential energy U(q) with an inclination q  of the dipole.
Similar to other potential energies, there is a freedom in choosing the
angle where the potential energy U is taken to be zero. A natural choice
is to take q0 = p / 2. (A n explanation for it is provided towards the end of
discussion.)   We can then write,

 EXAMPLE  2.6This expression can alternately be understood also from Eq. (2.29).
We apply Eq. (2.29) to the present system of two charges + q and – q. The
potential energy  expression then reads
()( ) ( )2
1 2[ ]4 2qU q V Vaθε0= − −′π ×r r (2.33)
Here, r1 and r2 denote the position vectors of + q and – q. Now, the
potential difference between positions r1 and r2 equals the work done
in bringing a unit positive charge against field from r2 to r1. The
displacement parallel to the force is 2 a cosq. Thus, [ V(r1)–V (r2)] =
–E × 2a cosq . We thus obtain,
()2 2
cos4 2 4 2θ θε ε0 0= − − = − − ′π × π ×p.Eq qU pEa a(2.34)
We note that U¢ (q) differs fr om U(q) by a quantity which is just a constant
for a given dipole. Since a constant is insignificant for potential  energy, we
can drop the second term in Eq. (2.34) and it then reduces to Eq. (2.32).
We can now understand why we took q0=p/2. In this case, the work
done against the exter nal field E in bringing + q and – q are equal and
opposite and cancel out, i.e., q [V (r1)  – V (r2)]=0.
Example 2.6  A molecule of a substance has a permanent electric
dipole moment of magnitude 10–29 C m. A mole of this substance is
polarised (at low temperature) by applying a strong electrostatic field
of magnitude 106 V m–1. The direction of the field is suddenly changed
by an angle of 60º. Estimate the heat released by the substance in
aligning its dipoles along the new direction of the field. For simplicity,
assume 100% polarisation of the sample.
Solution   Here, dipole moment of each molecules = 10–29 C m
As 1 mole of the substance contains 6 × 1023 molecules,
total dipole moment of all the molecules, p = 6 × 1023 × 10–29 C m
    = 6 × 10–6
 C m
Initial potential energy, Ui = –pE cos q = –6×10–6×106 cos 0° = –6 J
Final potential energy (when q = 60°), Uf = –6 × 10–6 × 106 cos 60° = –3 J
Change in potential energy = –3 J – (–6J) = 3 J
So, there is loss in potential energy. This must be the energy released
by the substance in the form of heat in aligning its dipoles.
2.9  E LECTROST ATICS OF CONDUCTORS
Conductors and insulators were described briefly in Chapter 1.
Conductors contain mobile charge carriers. In metallic conductors, these
charge carriers are electrons. In a metal, the outer (valence) electrons
part away from their atoms and are free to move. These electrons are free
within the metal but not free  to leave the metal. The free electrons form a
kind of ‘gas’; they collide with each other and with the ions, and move
randomly in different directions. In an external electric field, they drift
against the direction of the field. The positive ions made up of the nuclei
and the bound electrons remain held in their fixed positions. In electrolytic
conductors, the charge carriers are both positive and negative ions; but
Rationalised 2023-24
Physics
62the situation in this case is more involved – the movement of the charge
carriers is affected both by the external electric field as also by the
so-called chemical for ces (see Chapter 3). W e shall r estrict our discussion
to metallic solid conductors. Let us note important results regarding
electrostatics of conductors.
1. Inside a conductor , electr ostatic field is zer o
Consider a conductor , neutral or char ged. Ther e may also be an exter nal
electrostatic field. In the static situation, when there is no current inside
or on the sur face of the conductor , the electric field is zer o everywher e
inside the conductor . This fact can be taken as the defining pr operty of a
conductor . A conductor has fr ee electr ons. As long as electric field is not
zero, the free charge carriers would experience force and drift. In the
static situation, the free charges have so distributed themselves that the
electric field is zero everywhere inside. Electrostatic field is zero inside a
conductor .
2.At the sur face of a char ged conductor , electr ostatic field
must be normal to the surface at every point
If E were not normal to the surface, it would have some non-zero
component along the surface. Free charges on the surface of the conductor
would then experience force and move. In the static situation, therefore,
E should have no tangential component. Thus electrostatic field  at the
surface of a char ged conductor must be nor mal to the sur face at every
point. (For a conductor without any surface charge density, field is zero
even at the surface.) See result 5.
3.The interior of a conductor can have no excess charge in
the static situation
A neutral conductor has equal amounts of positive and negative charges
in every small volume or surface element. When the conductor is charged,
the excess charge can reside only on the surface in the static situation.
This follows from the Gauss’s law. Consider any arbitrary volume element
v inside a conductor . On the closed sur face S bounding the volume
element v, electrostatic field is zero. Thus the total electric flux through S
is zero. Hence, by Gauss’s law, there is no net charge enclosed by S. But
the surface S can be made as small as you like, i.e., the volume v can be
made vanishingly small. This means there is no net charge at any point
inside the conductor , and any excess char ge must r eside at the sur face.
4.Electrostatic potential is constant throughout the volume
of the conductor and has the same value (as inside) on
its surface
This follows from results 1 and 2 above. Since E = 0 inside the conductor
and has no tangential component on the surface, no work is done in
moving a small test charge within the conductor and on its surface. That
is, there is no potential difference between any two points inside or on
the sur face of the conductor . Hence, the r esult. If the conductor is char ged,
Rationalised 2023-24
Electrostatic Potential
and Capacitance
63electric field normal to the surface exists; this means potential will be
different for the surface and a point just outside the surface.
In a system of conductors of arbitrary size, shape and
charge configuration, each conductor is characterised by a constant
value of potential, but this constant may differ from one conductor to
the other .
5.Electric field at the surface of a charged conductor
0ˆσ
ε=E n (2.35)
where s is the surface charge density and ˆn is a unit vector normal
to the surface in the outward direction.
To derive the result, choose a pill box (a short cylinder) as the Gaussian
surface about any point P on the surface, as shown in Fig. 2.17. The pill
box is partly inside and partly outside the surface of the conductor. It
has a small area of cross section d S and negligible height.
Just inside the surface, the electrostatic field is zero; just outside, the
field is normal to the surface with magnitude E. Thus,
the contribution to the total flux through the pill box
comes only from the outside (circular) cross-section
of the pill box. This equals  ± EdS (positive for s > 0,
negative for s < 0), since over the small area  dS, E
may be considered constant and E and dS are parallel
or antiparallel. The charge enclosed by the pill box
is  sdS.
By Gauss’s law
EdS = 
0Sσ δ
ε
E = 
0σ
ε(2.36)
Including the fact that electric field is normal to the
surface, we get the vector relation, Eq. (2.35), which
is true for both signs of s. For s > 0, electric field is
normal to the surface outward; for s < 0, electric field
is normal to the surface inward.
6.Electrostatic shielding
Consider a conductor with a cavity, with no charges inside the cavity. A
remarkable result is that the electric field inside the cavity is zero, whatever
be the size and shape of the cavity and whatever be the charge on the
conductor and the external fields in which it might be placed. We have
proved a simple case of this result already: the electric field inside a charged
spherical shell is zero. The proof of the result for the shell makes use of
the spherical symmetry of the shell (see Chapter 1). But the vanishing of
electric field in the (charge-free) cavity of a conductor is, as mentioned
above, a very general result. A related result is that even if the conductorFIGURE  2.17  The Gaussian surface

of a conductor with cavity. (There are no
charges placed in the cavity.)is charged or charges are induced on a neutral
conductor by an external field, all charges reside
only on the outer surface of a conductor with cavity.
The proofs of the results noted in Fig. 2.18 are
omitted here, but we note their important
implication. Whatever be the charge and field
configuration outside, any cavity in a conductor
remains shielded from outside electric influence: the
field inside the cavity is always zero . This is known
as electrostatic shielding . The effect can be made
use of in protecting sensitive instruments from
outside electrical influence. Figure 2.19 gives a
summary of the important electrostatic properties
of a conductor.

(d)A bird perches on a bare high power line, and nothing happens

Solution
(a)This is because the comb gets charged by friction. The molecules
in the paper gets polarised by the charged comb, resulting  in a
net force of attraction. If the hair is wet, or if it is rainy day, friction
between hair and the comb reduces. The comb does not get
charged and thus it will not attract small bits of paper .FIGURE  2.19  Some important electr ostatic pr operties of a conductor .

2.10  D IELECTRICS AND P OLARISATION
Dielectrics are non-conducting substances. In contrast to conductors,
they have no (or negligible number o f) charge carriers. Recall from Section
2.9 what happens when a conductor is placed in an
external electric field. The free charge carriers move
and charge distribution in the conductor adjusts
itself in such a way that the electric field due to
induced charges opposes the external field within
the conductor. This happens until, in the static
situation, the two fields cancel each other and the
net electrostatic field in the conductor is zero. In a
dielectric, this free movement of charges is not
possible. It turns out that the external field induces
dipole moment by stretching or re-orienting
molecules of the dielectric. The collective effect of all
the molecular dipole moments is net charges  on the
surface of the dielectric which produce a field that
opposes the external field.  Unlike in a conductor,
however, the opposing field so induced does not
exactly cancel the external field. It only reduces it.
The extent of the effect depends on the
nature of the dielectric. To understand the
effect, we need to look at the charge
distribution of a dielectric at the
molecular level.
The molecules of a substance may be
polar or non-polar. In a non-polar
molecule, the centres of positive and
negative charges coincide. The molecule
then has no permanent (or intrinsic) dipole
moment. Examples of non-polar molecules
are oxygen (O2) and hydrogen (H2)
molecules which, because of their
symmetry, have no dipole moment. On the
other hand, a polar molecule is one in which
the centres of positive and negative charges
are separated (even when there is no
external field). Such molecules have a
permanent dipole moment. An ionic
molecule such as HCl or a molecule of water
(H2O) are examples of polar molecules.FIGURE  2.20  Difference in behaviour
of a conductor and a dielectric
in an external electric field.
FIGURE  2.21  Some examples of polar
and non-polar molecules.
Rationalised 2023-24
Physics
66In an external electric field, the
positive and negative charges of a non-
polar molecule are displaced in opposite
directions. The displacement stops when
the external force on the constituent
charges of the molecule is balanced by
the restoring force (due to internal fields
in the molecule). The non-polar molecule
thus develops an induced dipole moment.
The dielectric is said to be polarised by
the exter nal field. W e consider only the
simple situation when the induced dipole
moment is in the direction of the field and
is proportional to the field strength.
(Substances for which th is assumption
is true are called linear isotropic
dielectrics. ) The induced dipole moments
of different molecules add up giving a net
dipole moment of the dielectric in the
presence of the external field.
A dielectric with polar molecules also
develops a net dipole moment in an
external field, but for a different reason.
In the absence of any external field, the
different permanent dipoles are oriented
randomly due to thermal agitation; so
the total dipole moment is zero. When
an external field is applied, the individual dipole moments tend  to align
with the field. When summed overall the molecules, there is then a net
dipole moment in the direction of the external field, i.e., the dielectric is
polarised. The extent of polarisation depends on the relative strength of
two mutually opposite factors: the dipole potential energy in the external
field tending to align the dipoles with the field and thermal energy tending
to disrupt the alignment. There may be, in addition, the  ‘induced dipole
moment’ effect as for non-polar molecules, but generally the alignment
effect is more important for polar molecules.
Thus in either case, whether polar or non-polar , a dielectric develops
a net dipole moment in the presence of an external field. The dipole
moment per unit volume is called polarisation  and is denoted by P. For
linear isotropic dielectrics,
0ε χ=P Ee (2.37)
where ce is a constant characteristic of the dielectric and is known as the
electric susceptibility  of the dielectric medium.
It is possible to relate ce to the molecular properties of the substance,
but we shall not pursue that here.
The question is: how does the polarised dielectric modify the original
external field inside it? Let us consider, for simplicity, a rectangular
dielectric slab placed in a uniform external field E0 parallel to two of its
faces. The field causes a uniform polarisation P of the dielectric. ThusFIGURE  2.22 A dielectric develops a net dipole
moment in an external electric field. (a) Non-polar

67every volume element Dv of the slab has a dipole moment
P Dv in the direction of the field. The volume element Dv  is
macroscopically small but contains a very large number of
molecular dipoles. Anywhere inside the dielectric, the
volume element Dv
 has no net charge (though it has net
dipole moment). This is, because, the positive charge of one
dipole sits close to the negative charge of the adjacent dipole.
However , at the sur faces of the dielectric nor mal to the
electric field, there is evidently a net charge density. As seen
in Fig 2.23, the positive ends of the dipoles remain
unneutralised at the right surface and the negative ends at
the left surface. The unbalanced charges are the induced
charges due to the external field.
Thus, the polarised dielectric is equivalent to two charged
surfaces with induced surface charge densities, say sp
and – sp. Clearly, the field produced by these surface charges
opposes the external field. The total field in the dielectric
is, thereby, reduced from the case when no dielectric is
present. We should note that the surface charge density
±sp arises from bound (not free charges) in the dielectric.
2.11  C APACITORS AND C APACITANCE
A capacitor is a system of two conductors separated by an insulator
(Fig. 2.24). The conductors have charges, say Q1 and Q2, and potentials
V1 and V2. Usually, in practice, the two conductors have charges Q
and – Q, with potential difference V = V1 – V2 between them. We shall
consider only this kind of charge configuration of the capacitor. (Even a
single conductor can be used as a capacitor by assuming the other at
infinity.) The conductors may be so charged by connecting them to the
two terminals of a battery. Q is called the charge of the capacitor, though
this, in fact, is the charge on one of the conductors – the total charge  of
the capacitor  is zero.
The electric field in the region between the
conductors is proportional to the charge Q. That
is, if the charge on the capacitor is, say  doubled,
the electric field will also be doubled at every point.
(This follows from the direct proportionality
between field and charge implied by Coulomb’s
law and the superposition principle.) Now,
potential difference V is the work done per unit
positive charge in taking a small test charge from
the conductor 2 to 1 against the field.
Consequently, V is also proportio nal to Q, and the
ratio Q/V is a constant:
QCV= (2.38)
The constant C is called the capacitance  of the capacitor. C is independent
of Q or V, as stated above. The capacitance C depends only on theFIGURE  2.23  A uniformly
polarised dielectric amounts

density, but no volume
charge density.

68geometrical configuration (shape, size, separation) of the system of two
conductors. [As we shall see later, it also depends on the nature of the
insulator (dielectric) separating the two conductors.]  The SI unit of
capacitance is 1 farad (=1 coulomb volt-1) or 1 F = 1 C V–1. A capacitor
with fixed capacitance is symbolically shown as - --||---, while the one with
variable capacitance is shown as  .
Equation (2.38) shows that for large C, V is small for a given Q. This
means a capacitor with large capacitance can hold large amount of charge
Q at a r elatively small V. This is of practical importance. High potential
difference implies strong electric field around the conductors. A strong
electric field can ionise the surrounding air and accelerate the charges so
produced to the oppositely charged plates, thereby neutralising the charge
on the capacitor plates, at least partly. In other words, the charge of the
capacitor leaks away due to the reduction in insulating power of the
intervening medium.
The maximum electric field that a dielectric medium can withstand
without break-down (of its insulating property) is called its dielectric
strength ; for air it is about 3 × 106 Vm–1. For a separation between
conductors of the order of 1 cm or so, this field corresponds to a potential
difference of 3 × 104 V between the conductors. Thus, for a capacitor to
store a large amount of charge without  leaking, its capacitance should
be high enough so that the potential difference and hence the electric
field do not exceed the break-down limits. Put differently, there is a limit
to the amount of charge that can be stored on a given capacitor without
significant leaking. In practice, a farad is a very big unit; the most common
units are its sub-multiples 1 mF = 10–6 F, 1 nF = 10–9 F, 1 pF = 10–12 F,
etc. Besides its use in storing charge, a capacitor is a key element of most
ac circuits with important functions, as described in Chapter 7.
2.12  T HE PARALLEL  PLATE CAPACITOR
A parallel plate capacitor consists of two large plane parallel conducting
plates separated by a small distance (Fig. 2.25). We first take the
intervening medium between the plates to be
vacuum. The effect of a dielectric medium between
the plates is discussed in the next section. Let A be
the area of each plate and d the separation between
them. The two plates have charges Q and – Q. Since
d is much smaller than the linear dimension of the
plates ( d2 << A), we can use the result on electric
field by an infinite plane sheet of uniform surface
charge density (Section 1.15). Plate 1 has surface
charge density s = Q/A and plate 2 has a surface
charge density – s. Using Eq. (1.33), the electric field
in different regions is:
Outer region I (region  above the plate 1),

to the two charged plates add up, giving
0 0 0 02 2QEAσ σ σ
ε ε ε ε= + = = (2.41)
The direction of electric field is from the positive to the negative plate.
Thus, the electric field is localised between the two plates and is
uniform throughout. For plates with finite area, this will not be true near
the outer boundaries of the plates. The field lines bend outward at the
edges — an effect called ‘fringing of the field’. By the same token, s will
not be strictly uniform on the entire plate. [ E and s are related by Eq.
(2.35).] However , for d2 << A, these ef fects can be ignor ed in the r egions
sufficiently far from the edges, and the field there is given by Eq. (2.41).
Now for uniform electric field, potential difference is simply the electric
field times the distance between the plates, that is,
01QdV E dAε= = (2.42)
The capacitance C of the parallel plate capacitor is then
QCV= = 0A
dε= (2.43)
which, as expected, depends only on the geometry of the system. For
typical values like A = 1 m2, d = 1 mm, we get

This shows that 1F is too big a unit in practice, as r emarked earlier .

plates needed to have C = 1F for a separation of, say 1 cm:

2.13  E FFECT OF DIELECTRIC  ON CAPACITANCE
With the understanding of the behaviour of dielectrics in an external
field developed in Section 2.10, let us see how the capacitance of a parallel
plate capacitor is modified when a dielectric is present. As before, we
have two large plates, each of area A, separated by a distance d. The
charge on the plates is ± Q, corresponding to the charge density ± s (with
s = Q/A). When there is vacuum between the plates,

The capacitance C0 in this case is

0Q ACV dε= = (2.46)
Consider next a dielectric inserted between the plates fully occupying
the intervening region. The dielectric is polarised by the field and, as
explained in Section 2.10, the effect is equivalent to two charged sheets
(at the surfaces of the dielectric normal to the field) with surface charge
densities sp and – sp. The electric field in the dielectric then corresponds
to the case when the net surface charge density on the plates is ±( s – sp).
That is,
0PEσ σ
ε−= (2.47)
so that the potential difference across the plates is
0PV E d dσ σ
ε−= = (2.48)
For linear dielectrics, we expect sp to be proportional to E0, i.e., to s.
Thus, ( s – sp) is proportional to s  and we can write

wher e K is a constant characteristic of the dielectric. Clearly,  K > 1. W e

 The pr oduct e0K is called the permittivity  of the medium and is
denoted by e
e = e0 K (2.52)
For vacuum K  = 1 and e = e0; e0 is called the permittivity of the vacuum .
The dimensionless ratio
0Kε
ε= (2.53)
is called the dielectric constant  of the substance. As remarked before,
from Eq. (2.49), it is clear that K is greater than 1. From Eqs. (2.46) and
(2. 51)
0CKC= (2.54)
Thus, the dielectric constant of a substance is the factor (>1) by which
the capacitance increases from its vacuum value, when the dielectric is

area as the plates of a parallel-plate capacitor but has a thickness
(3/4) d, where d is the separation of the plates. How is the capacitance
changed when the slab is inserted between the plates?
Solution Let  E0 = V0/d be the electric field between the plates when
there is no dielectric and the potential difference is V0. If the dielectric
is now inserted, the electric field in the dielectric will be E = E0/K.

2.14  C OMBINA TION OF CAPACITORS
We can combine several capacitors of
capacitance C1, C2,…, Cn to obtain a system with
some effective capacitance C. The effective
capacitance depends on the way the individual
capacitors are combined. Two simple
possibilities are discussed below.
2.14.1  Capacitors in series
Figure 2.26 shows capacitors C1 and C2
combined in series.
The left plate of C1 and the right plate of C2
are connected to two terminals of a battery and
have charges Q and – Q , respectively. It then
follows that the right plate of C1 has charge – Q
and the left plate of C2  has charge Q. If this was
not so, the net charge on each capacitor would
not be zero. This would result in an electric field
in the conductor connecting C1and C2. Charge
would flow until the net charge on both C1 and
C2 is zero and there is no electric field in the
conductor connecting C1 and C2. Thus, in the
series combination, charges on the two plates
(±Q) are the same on each capacitor . The totalFIGURE  2.26  Combination of two

Now we can regard the combination as an effective capacitor with
charge Q and potential dif ference V. The effective capacitance  of the
combination is
QCV= (2.57)
We compar e Eq. (2.57) with Eq. (2.56), and obtain
1 21 1 1
C C C= + (2.58)
The proof clearly goes through for any number of capacitors arranged
in a similar way. Equation (2.55), for n capacitors arranged in series,
generalises to
1 2 n
1 2 n... ...Q Q QV V V VC C C= + + + = + + + (2.59)
Following the same steps as for the case of two
capacitors, we get the general formula for effective
capacitance of a series combination of n capacitors:
1 2 3 n1 1 1 1 1...C C C C C= + + + + (2.60)
2.14.2  Capacitors in parallel
Figure 2.28 (a) shows two capacitors arranged in
parallel. In this case, the same potential difference is
applied across both the capacitors. But the plate charges
(±Q1) on capacitor 1 and the plate charges (± Q2) on the
capacitor 2 are not necessarily the same:
Q1 = C1V, Q2 = C2V (2.61)
The equivalent capacitor is one with charge
Q = Q1 + Q2(2.62)
and potential dif ference V.
Q = CV = C1V + C2V (2.63)
The effective capacitance C is, from Eq. (2.63),
C = C1 + C2(2.64)
The general formula for effective capacitance C for
parallel combination of  n capacitors [Fig. 2.28 (b)]
follows similarly,
Q = Q1 + Q2 + ... + Qn(2.65)
i.e., CV = C1V + C2V + ... CnV(2.66)

2.15  E NERGY S TORED IN  A CAPACITOR
A capacitor , as we have seen above, is a system of two conductors with
charge Q and – Q. To determine the energy stored in this configuration,
consider initially two uncharged conductors 1 and 2. Imagine next a
process of transferring charge from conductor 2 to conductor 1 bit by
Rationalised 2023-24
Physics
74bit, so that at the end, conductor 1 gets charge Q. By
charge conservation, conductor 2 has charge – Q at
the end (Fig 2.30 ) .
In transferring positive charge from conductor 2
to conductor 1, work will be done externally, since at
any stage conductor 1 is at a higher potential than
conductor 2. To calculate the total work done, we first
calculate the work done in a small step involving
transfer of an infinitesimal (i.e., vanishingly small)
amount of charge. Consider the intermediate situation
when the conductors 1 and 2 have charges Q¢ and
–Q¢ respectively. At this stage, the potential difference
V¢ between conductors 1 to 2 is Q¢/C, where C is the
capacitance of the system. Next imagine that a small
charge d Q¢ is transferr ed from conductor 2 to 1. W ork
done in this step ( d W), resulting in charge Q¢ on
conductor 1 increasing to Q¢+ d Q¢, is given by

Since electrostatic force is conservative, this work is stored in the form
of potential energy of the system. For the same reason, the final result for
potential energy [Eq. (2.69)] is independent of the manner in which the
charge configuration of the capacitor is built up. When the capacitor
discharges, this stored-up energy is released. It is possible to view the
potential energy of the capacitor as ‘stored’ in the electric field between
the plates. To see this, consider for simplicity, a parallel plate capacitor
[of area A (of each plate) and separation d between the plates].

gone?
There is a transient period before the system settles to the

the first capacitor to the second. Energy is lost during this time in
the form of heat and electromagnetic radiation. EXAMPLE  2.10
SUMMARY
1.Electr ostatic for ce is a conservative for ce. W ork done by an exter nal
force (equal and opposite to the electrostatic force) in bringing a charge
q from a point R to a point P is q(VP–VR), which is the difference in
potential energy of charge q between the final and initial points.
2.Potential at a point is the work done per unit charge (by an external
agency) in bringing a charge from infinity to that point. Potential at a
point is arbitrary to within an additive constant, since it is the potential
difference between two points which is physically significant. If potential
at infinity is chosen to be zero; potential at a point with position vector

The potential energy of a dipole moment p in a uniform electric field E

 8.Electrostatics field E is zero in the interior of a conductor; just outside
the sur face of a char ged conductor , E is nor mal to the sur face given by
0ˆσ
ε=E n  where ˆn is the unit vector along the outward normal to the
surface and s is the surface charge density. Charges in a conductor can
reside only at its surface. Potential is constant within and on the surface
of a conductor . In a cavity within a conductor (with no char ges), the
electric field is zero.
9. A capacitor is a system of two conductors separated by an insulator . Its
capacitance is defined by C = Q/V , where Q and –Q are the charges on the
two conductors and V is the potential difference between them. C is
determined purely geometrically, by the shapes, sizes and relative
positions of the two conductors. The unit of capacitance is farad:,
1 F = 1 C V–1. For a parallel plate capacitor (with vacuum between the
plates),
C = 0A
dε
where A is the area of each plate and d the separation between them.
10.If the medium between the plates of a capacitor is filled with an insulating
substance (dielectric), the electric field due to the charged plates induces
a net dipole moment in the dielectric. This effect, called polarisation,
gives rise to a field in the opposite direction. The net electric field inside
the dielectric and hence the potential difference between the plates is
thus reduced. Consequently, the capacitance C increases from its value
C0 when there is no medium (vacuum),
C = KC0
where K is the dielectric constant of the insulating substance.
11.For capacitors in the series combination, the total capacitance C is given by

POINTS TO PONDER
1.Electrostatics deals with forces between charges at rest. But if there is a
force on a charge, how can it be at rest? Thus, when we are talking of
electrostatic force between charges, it should be understood that each
charge is being kept at rest by some unspecified force that opposes the
net Coulomb force on the charge.
2.A capacitor is so configured that it confines the electric field lines within
a small region of space. Thus, even though field may have considerable
strength, the potential difference between the two conductors of a
capacitor is small.
3.Electric field is discontinuous across the surface of a spherical charged
shell. It is zero inside and σε0ˆn outside. Electric potential is, however
continuous across the surface, equal to q/4pe0R  at the surface.
4.The torque p × E on a dipole causes it to oscillate about E. Only if there
is a dissipative mechanism, the oscillations are damped and the dipole
eventually aligns with E.
5.Potential due to a charge q at its own location is not defined – it is
infinite.
6.In the expression qV(r) for potential energy of a charge q, V(r) is the
potential due to external charges and not the potential due to q. As seen
in point 5, this expression will be ill-defined if V(r) includes potential
due to a charge q itself.

797.A cavity inside a conductor is shielded from outside electrical influences.
It is worth noting that electrostatic shielding does not work the other
way round; that is, if you put charges inside the cavity, the exterior of
the conductor is not shielded from the fields by the inside charges.

Electrostatics_wiki:
An electrostatic effect: foam peanuts clinging to a
cat's fur due to static electricity. The triboelectric
effect causes an electrostatic charge to build up on
the surface of the fur due to the cat's motions. The
electric field of the charge causes polarization of the
molecules of the foam due to electrostatic induction,
resulting in a slight attraction of the light plastic
pieces to the charged fur.[1][2][3][4] This effect is also
the cause of static cling in clothes.Electrostatics
Electrostatics is a branch of physics that studies
electric charges at rest (static electricity).
Since classical times, it has been know n that some
materials, such as amber, attract lightweight particles
after rubbing. The Greek word for amber, ἤλεκτρον
( ḗlektron), was thus the source of the word
'electricity'. Electrostatic phenomena arise from the
forces that electric charges exert on each other. Such
forces are described by Coulomb's law.
Even though electrostatically induc ed forces seem to
be rather weak, some electrostatic forces are
relatively large. The force between an electron and a
proton, which together make up a hydrogen atom, is
about 36 orders of magnitude stronge r than the
gravitational force acting be tween them.
There are many examples of electrostatic phenomena,
from those as simple as the attraction of plastic wrap
to one's hand after it is removed from a package, to
the apparently spontaneous explosion of grain silos,
the damage of electronic compone nts during
manufacturing, and photocopier & laser printer operation. Electrostatics involves the buildup of charge on
the surface of objects due to contact with other surfaces. Although charge exchange happens whenever any
two surfaces contact and separate, the effects of charge exchange are usually noticed only when at least one
of the surfaces has a high resistance to electrical flow, because the charges that transfer are trapped there for
a long enough time for their effects to be observed. These charges then remain on the object until they
either bleed off to ground, or are quickly neutralized by a discharge. The familiar phenomenon of a static
"shock" is caused by t he neutralization of  charge built up in the body f rom contact with insulated surfaces.
Coulomb's law states that:
'The magnitude of the electrostatic force of attraction or repulsion between two point charges is directly
proportional to the produc t of the magnitudes of charges and inversely proportional to the square of the
distance between them.'
The force is along the straight line joining them. If the two charges have the same sign, the electrostatic
force between them is repulsive; if they have different signs, the force between them is attractive.
If  is the distance (in meters) between two charges, then the force (in newtons) between two point charges
 and  (in coulombs) is:Coulomb's lawThe electrostatic field (lines with arrows) of a nearby positive charge (+)
causes the mobile charges in conductive objects to separate due to
electrostatic induction. Negative charges (blue) are attracted and move to
the surface of the object facing the external charge. Positive charges (red)
are repelled and move to the surface facing away. These induced surface
charges are exactly the right size and shape so their opposing electric field
cancels the electric field of the external charge throughout the interior of
the metal. Therefore, the electrostatic field everywhere inside a conductive
object is zero, and the electrostatic potential is constant.where ε0 is the vacuum permittivity, or permittivity of free space:[5]
The SI units of ε0 are equivalently A2⋅s4 ⋅kg−1⋅m−3 or C2⋅N−1⋅m−2 or F ⋅m−1. The Coulomb constant is:
A single proton has a charge of e, and the electron has a charge of −e, where,
These physical constants (ε0, ke, e) are currently defined so that e is exactly defined, and ε0 and ke are
measured qua ntities.
The electric field, , in units of
newtons per coulomb or volts
per meter, is a vector field that
can be defined everywhere,
except at the location of point
charges (where it diverges to
infinity).[6] It is defined as the
electrostatic force  in newtons
on a hypot hetical small test
charge at the point due to
Coulomb's Law, divided by the
magnitude of the charge  in
coulombs
Electric field lines are useful for
visualizing the electric field.
Field lines begin on positive
charge and terminate on negative
charge. They are parallel to the
direction of the electric field at
each point, and the density of
these field lines is a measure of
the magnitude of the electric
field at any gi ven poi nt.Electric fieldConsider a collection of  particles of charge , located at points  (called source points), the electric
field at  (called the field poi nt) is:[6]
where  is the displacement vector from a source point  to the field point , and
 is a unit vector that indicates the direction of the field. For a single point charge at the
origin, the magnitude of this electric field is  and points away from that charge if it is
positive. The fact that the force (and hence the field) can be calculated by summing over all the
contributions due to individual source particles is an example of the superposition principle. The electric
field produc ed by a distribution of charges is given by the volume charge density  and can be obtained
by conve rting this sum into a triple integral:
Gauss' law states that "the total electric flux through any closed surface in free space of any shape drawn in
an electric field is proportional to the total electric charge enclosed by the surface." Mathematically, Gauss's
law takes the form of an integral equation:
where  is a volume element. If the charge is distributed over a surface or along a line,
replace  by  or . The divergence theorem allows Gauss's Law to be written in differential
form:
where  is the divergence operator.
The definition of electrostatic potential, combined with the differential form of Gauss's law (above ),
provides a relationship between the potential Φ and the charge density ρ:
This relationship is a form of Poisson's equation. In the absence of unpa ired electric charge, the equation
becomes Laplace's equation:Gauss' law
Poisson and Laplace equationsThe validity of the electrostatic approximation rests on the assumption that the electric field is irrotational:
From Faraday's law, this assumption implies the absence or near-absence of time-varying m agnetic fields:
In other words, electrostatics does not require the absence of magnetic fields or electric currents. Rather, if
magnetic fields or electric currents do exist, they must not change with time, or in the worst-case, they must
change with time only very slowly. In some problems, both electrostatics and magnetostatics may be
required for accurate predictions, but the coupling between the two can still be ignored. Electrostatics and
magnetostatics can bot h be seen as Galilean limits for electromagnetism.[7]
As the electric field is irrotational, it is possible to express the electric field as the gradient of a scalar
function, , called the electrostatic potential (also know n as the voltage). An electric field, , points from
regions of high electric potential to regions of low electric potential, expressed mathematically as
The gradient theorem can be used to establish that the electrostatic potential is the amount of work per unit
charge required to move a charge from point  to poi nt  with the following line integral:
From these equations, we see that the electric potential is constant in any region for which the electric field
vanishes (such as occurs inside a conduc ting obj ect).
A test particle's potential energy, , can be calculated from a line integral of the work, . We
integrate from a point at infinity, and assume a collection of  particles of charge , are already situated
at the points . This potential energy (in Joules) is:Electrostatic approximation
Electrostatic potential
Electrostatic energywhere  is the distance of each charge  from the test charge , which situated at the point ,
and  is the electric potential that would be at  if the test charge were not present. If only two charges
are present, the potential energy is . The total electric potential energy due a collection of N
charges is calculating by a ssembling these particles one at a time:
where the following sum from, j = 1 to N, excludes i = j:
This electric potential,  is what would be measured at  if the charge  were missing. This formula
obviously excludes the (infinite) energy that would be required to assemble each point charge from a
disperse cloud of charge. The sum over charges can be conve rted into an integral over charge density using
the prescription :
This second expression for electrostatic energy uses the fact that the electric field is the negative gradient of
the electric potential, as well as vector calculus identities in a way that resembles integration by parts. These
two integrals for electric field energy seem to indicate two mutually exclusive formulas for electrostatic
energy density, namely  and ; they yield equal values for the total electrostatic energy only if
both are integrated ove r all space.
On a conduc tor, a surface charge will experience a force in the presence of an electric field. This force is
the average of the discontinuous  electric field at the surface charge. This average in terms of the field just
outside the surface amounts to:
This pressure tends to draw the conduc tor into the field, regardless of the sign of  the surface charge.
The triboelectric effect is a type of contact electrification in which certain materials become electrically
charged when they are brought  into contact with a different material and then separated. One of the
materials acquires a positive charge, and the other acquires an equal negative charge. The polarity and
strength of the charges produc ed differ according to the materials, surface roughne ss, temperature, strain,
and other properties. Amber, for example, can acquire an electric charge by friction with a material likeElectrostatic pressure
Triboelectric effectwool. This property, first recorded by Thales of Miletus, was the first electrical phenomenon investigated
by humans. Other examples of materials that can acquire a significant charge when rubbe d together include
glass rubbe d with silk, and ha rd rubbe r rubbe d with fur.
The presence of surface charge imbalance means that the objects will exhibit attractive or repulsive forces.
This surface charge imbalance, which yields static electricity, can be generated by touching two differing
surfaces together and then separating them due to the phenomena of contact electrification and the
triboelectric effect. Rubbing two nonc onduc tive objects generates a great amount of static electricity. This is
not just the result of friction; two nonc onductive surfaces can become charged by just being placed one on
top of the other. Since most surfaces have a rough texture, it takes longe r to achieve charging through
contact than through rubbing. Rubbing objects together increases the amount of adhesive contact between
the two surfaces. Usually insulators, i.e., substances that do not conduc t electricity, are good at both
generating, and holding, a surface charge. Some examples of these substances are rubbe r, plastic, glass, and
pith. Conduc tive objects rarely generate charge imbalance, except when a metal surface is impacted by
solid or liquid nonc onduc tors. The charge that is transferred during contact electrification is stored on the
surface of each object. Electrostatic generators, devices which produc e very high voltage at very low
current and us ed for classroom phys ics demonstrations, rely on t his effect.
The presence of electric current does not detract from the electrostatic forces nor from the sparking, from
the corona discharge, or other phenomena. Both phe nomena can exist simultaneously in the same system.
See also: Wimshurst machine, and Van de Graaff generator.
The most familiar natural electrostatic phenomenon, often regarded as an occasional annoya nce in seasons
of low humidity, is Static electricity. Static electricity is generally harmless, but it can be destructive and
harmful in some situations (e.g. electronics manufacturing), when working in direct contact with integrated
circuit electronics (especially delicate MOSFETs). In the presence of flammable gas, care must be taken to
avoid accumulating and sudde nly discharging a static charge (see Electrostatic discharge), because an
electrostatic spark can ignite the gas.
Electrostatic induc tion, discovered by British scientist John Canton in 1753 and Swedish professor Johan
Carl Wilcke in 1762[8][9][10] is a redistribution of charges in an object caused by the electric field of a
nearby charge. For example, if a positively charged object is brought  near an uncharged metal object, the
mobile negatively-charged electrons in the metal will be attracted by the external charge, and move to the
side of the metal facing it, creating a negative charge on the surface. When the electrons move out of an
area they leave a positive charge due to the metal atoms' nuclei, so the side of the metal object facing away
from the charge acquires a positive charge. These induc ed charges disappear when the external charge is
removed. Induc tion is also responsible for the attraction of light objects, such as balloons, paper scraps and
foam packing peanuts to static charges. The surface charges induc ed in conduc tive objects exactly cancel
external electric fields inside the conduc tor, so there is no electric field inside a metal object. This is theElectrostatic generators
Charge neutralization
Electrostatic inductionLightning over Oradea in Romaniabasis for the electric field shielding action of a Faraday cage. Since the electric field is the gradient of the
voltage, electrostatic induc tion is also responsible for making the electric potential (voltage) constant
throughout  a conduc tive object.
Before the year 1832, when Michael Faraday published the results
of his experiment on the identity of electricities, physicists thought
"static electricity" was somehow different from other electrical
charges. Michael Faraday proved that the electricity induc ed from
the magnet, voltaic electricity produc ed by a battery, and static
electricity are all the same.
Static electricity is usually caused when certain materials are rubbe d
against each other, like wool on plastic or the soles of shoes on
carpet. The process causes electrons to be pulled from the surface of
one material and relocated on t he surface of the other material.
A static shock occurs when the surface of the second material,
negatively charged with electrons, touches a (relatively) positively
charged conduc tor, or vice versa.
Static electricity is commonly used in xerography, air filters, and
some coating processes used in manufacturing. Static electricity is a
build-up of electric charges on two objects that have become
separated from each other. Small electrical compone nts can be
damaged by static electricity, and compone nt manufacturers use a
number of antistatic devices to avoid this.
When different materials are brought  together and then separated, an accumulation of electric charge can
occur which leaves one material positively charged while the other becomes negatively charged. The mild
shock that you receive when touching a grounde d object after walking on carpet is an example of excess
electrical charge accumulating in your body from frictional charging between your shoes and the carpet.
The resulting charge build-up upon your body can generate a strong electrical discharge. Although
experimenting with static electricity may be fun, similar sparks create severe hazards in those industries
dealing with flammable substances, where a small electrical spark may ignite explosive mixtures with
devastating consequences.
A similar charging mechanism can occur within low conduc tivity fluids flowing through pipelines—a
process called flow electrification. F luids which have low electrical conduc tivity (below 50 pi cosiemens per
meter), are called accumulators. Fluids having conduc tivities above  50 pS/m are called non-accumulators.
In non-accumulators, charges recombine as fast as they are separated and hence electrostatic charge
generation is not significant. In the petrochemical industry, 50 pS/m is the recommended minimum value of
electrical conduc tivity for adequate removal of charge from a fluid.
An important concept for insulating fluids is the static relaxation time. This is similar to the time constant
(tau) within an RC circuit. For insulating materials, it is the ratio of the static dielectric constant divided by
the electrical conduc tivity of the material. For hydrocarbon fluids, this is sometimes approximated by
dividing the number 18 by the electrical conduc tivity of the fluid. Thus a fluid that has an electricalStatic electricity
Static electricity and chemical industryconduc tivity of 1 pS/cm (100 pS/m) will have an estimated relaxation time of about 18 seconds. The excess
charge within a fluid will be almost completely dissipated after 4 to 5 times the relaxation time, or 90
seconds  for the fluid in the above  example.
Charge generation increases at higher fluid velocities and larger pipe diameters, becoming quite significant
in pipes 8 inches (200 mm) or larger. Static charge generation in these systems is best controlled by limiting
fluid velocity. The British standard BS PD CLC/TR 50404: 2003 (formerly BS-5958- Part 2) Code of
Practice for Control of Undesirable Static Electricity prescribes velocity limits. Because of its large impact
on dielectric constant, the recommended velocity for hydrocarbon fluids containing water should be limited
to 1 m /s.
Bonding and earthing are the usual ways by which charge buildup can be prevented. For fluids with
electrical conduc tivity below 10 pS/m, bonding and earthing are not adequate for charge dissipation, and
anti-static additives may be required.

Electrostatic induc tion was used in the past to build high-voltage generators know n as influence machines.
The main compone nt that emerged in these times is the capacitor. Electrostatic induc tion is also used for
electro-mechanic precipitation or projection. In such technologies, charged particles of small sizes are
collected or deposited intentionally on surfaces. Applications range from electrostatic precipitator to
electrostatic coating and inkjet printing.
Electrostatic actuators have recently been attracting interest in the soft robotics research area. Electrostatic
actuators can be employed as clutches for wearable devices which can exhibit mechanical impedance
tuning and improved energy efficiency.[11][12][13] Other relevant applications include but not limited to
multimode hydraulically amplified electrostatic actuators for wearable haptics [14] and robots driven by
electrostatic actuator.[15][16]

23.1Properties of Electric Charges709he electromagnetic force between charged particles is one of the fundamen-tal forces of nature. We begin this chapter by describing some of the basicproperties of electric forces. We then discuss Coulomb’s law, which is the fun-damental law governing the force between any two charged particles. Next, we in-troduce the concept of an electric ﬁeld associated with a charge distribution anddescribe its effect on other charged particles. We then show how to useCoulomb’s law to calculate the electric ﬁeld for a given charge distribution. Weconclude the chapter with a discussion of the motion of a charged particle in auniform electric ﬁeld.PROPERTIES OF ELECTRIC CHARGESA number of simple experiments demonstrate the existence of electric forces andcharges. For example, after running a comb through your hair on a dry day, youwill ﬁnd that the comb attracts bits of paper. The attractive force is often strongenough to suspend the paper. The same effect occurs when materials such as glassor rubber are rubbed with silk or fur.Another simple experiment is to rub an inﬂated balloon with wool. The bal-loon then adheres to a wall, often for hours. When materials behave in this way,they are said to be electriﬁed,or to have become electrically charged.You can eas-ily electrify your body by vigorously rubbing your shoes on a wool rug. The electriccharge on your body can be felt and removed by lightly touching (and startling) afriend. Under the right conditions, you will see a spark when you touch, and bothof you will feel a slight tingle. (Experiments such as these work best on a dry daybecause an excessive amount of moisture in the air can cause any charge you buildup to “leak” from your body to the Earth.)In a series of simple experiments, it is found that there are two kinds of elec-tric charges, which were given the names positive and negative by BenjaminFranklin (1706–1790). To verify that this is true, consider a hard rubber rod thathas been rubbed with fur and then suspended by a nonmetallic thread, as shownin Figure 23.1. When a glass rod that has been rubbed with silk is brought near therubber rod, the two attract each other (Fig. 23.1a). On the other hand, if twocharged rubber rods (or two charged glass rods) are brought near each other, asshown in Figure 23.1b, the two repel each other. This observation shows that therubber and glass are in two different states of electriﬁcation. On the basis of theseobservations, we conclude that like charges repel one another and unlikecharges attract one another.Using the convention suggested by Franklin, the electric charge on the glassrod is called positive and that on the rubber rod is called negative. Therefore, anycharged object attracted to a charged rubber rod (or repelled by a charged glassrod) must have a positive charge, and any charged object repelled by a chargedrubber rod (or attracted to a charged glass rod) must have a negative charge.Attractive electric forces are responsible for the behavior of a wide variety ofcommercial products. For example, the plastic in many contact lenses, etaﬁlcon,ismade up of molecules that electrically attract the protein molecules in humantears. These protein molecules are absorbed and held by the plastic so that thelens ends up being primarily composed of the wearer’s tears. Because of this, thewearer’s eye does not treat the lens as a foreign object, and it can be worn com-fortably. Many cosmetics also take advantage of electric forces by incorporatingmaterials that are electrically attracted to skin or hair, causing the pigments orother chemicals to stay put once they are applied.23.1T

710CHAPTER 23Electric Fields
Another important aspect of Franklin’s model of electricity is the implicationthat electric charge is always conserved.That is, when one object is rubbedagainst another, charge is not created in the process. The electriﬁed state is due toa transfer of charge from one object to the other. One object gains some amount ofnegative charge while the other gains an equal amount of positive charge. For ex-ample, when a glass rod is rubbed with silk, the silk obtains a negative charge thatis equal in magnitude to the positive charge on the glass rod. We now know fromour understanding of atomic structure that negatively charged electrons are trans-ferred from the glass to the silk in the rubbing process. Similarly, when rubber isrubbed with fur, electrons are transferred from the fur to the rubber, giving therubber a net negative charge and the fur a net positive charge. This process is con-sistent with the fact that neutral, uncharged matter contains as many positivecharges (protons within atomic nuclei) as negative charges (electrons).If you rub an inﬂated balloon against your hair, the two materials attract each other, asshown in Figure 23.2. Is the amount of charge present in the balloon and your hair afterrubbing (a) less than, (b) the same as, or (c) more than the amount of charge present be-fore rubbing?In 1909, Robert Millikan (1868–1953) discovered that electric charge alwaysoccurs as some integral multiple of a fundamental amount of charge e. In modernterms, the electric charge qis said to be quantized,where qis the standard symbolused for charge. That is, electric charge exists as discrete “packets,” and we canwrite where Nis some integer. Other experiments in the same periodshowed that the electron has a charge /H11002eand the proton has a charge of equalmagnitude but opposite sign /H11001e. Some particles, such as the neutron, have nocharge. A neutral atom must contain as many protons as electrons.Because charge is a conserved quantity, the net charge in a closed region re-mains the same. If charged particles are created in some process, they are alwayscreated in pairs whose members have equal-magnitude charges of opposite sign.q/H11005Ne,Quick Quiz 23.1RubberRubber

Charge is quantized23.2Insulators and Conductors711From our discussion thus far, we conclude that electric charge has the follow-ing important properties:•Two kinds of charges occur in nature, with the property that unlike chargesattract one another and like charges repel one another.•Charge is conserved.•Charge is quantized.Properties of electric chargeINSULATORS AND CONDUCTORSIt is convenient to classify substances in terms of their ability to conduct electriccharge:23.2Electrical conductors are materials in which electric charges move freely,whereas electrical insulators are materials in which electric charges cannotmove freely.Materials such as glass, rubber, and wood fall into the category of electrical insula-tors. When such materials are charged by rubbing, only the area rubbed becomescharged, and the charge is unable to move to other regions of the material.In contrast, materials such as copper, aluminum, and silver are good electricalconductors. When such materials are charged in some small region, the chargereadily distributes itself over the entire surface of the material. If you hold a cop-per rod in your hand and rub it with wool or fur, it will not attract a small piece ofpaper. This might suggest that a metal cannot be charged. However, if you attach awooden handle to the rod and then hold it by that handle as you rub the rod, therod will remain charged and attract the piece of paper. The explanation for this isas follows: Without the insulating wood, the electric charges produced by rubbingreadily move from the copper through your body and into the Earth. The insulat-ing wooden handle prevents the ﬂow of charge into your hand.Semiconductors are a third class of materials, and their electrical propertiesare somewhere between those of insulators and those of conductors. Silicon andgermanium are well-known examples of semiconductors commonly used in thefabrication of a variety of electronic devices, such as transistors and light-emittingdiodes. The electrical properties of semiconductors can be changed over many or-ders of magnitude by the addition of controlled amounts of certain atoms to thematerials.When a conductor is connected to the Earth by means of a conducting wire orpipe, it is said to be grounded.The Earth can then be considered an inﬁnite“sink” to which electric charges can easily migrate. With this in mind, we can un-derstand how to charge a conductor by a process known as induction.To understand induction, consider a neutral (uncharged) conducting sphereinsulated from ground, as shown in Figure 23.3a. When a negatively charged rub-ber rod is brought near the sphere, the region of the sphere nearest the rod ob-tains an excess of positive charge while the region farthest from the rod obtains anequal excess of negative charge, as shown in Figure 23.3b. (That is, electrons inthe region nearest the rod migrate to the opposite side of the sphere. This occurseven if the rod never actually touches the sphere.) If the same experiment is per-formed with a conducting wire connected from the sphere to ground (Fig. 23.3c),some of the electrons in the conductor are so strongly repelled by the presence of11.3

the negative charge in the rod that they move out of the sphere through theground wire and into the Earth. If the wire to ground is then removed (Fig.23.3d), the conducting sphere contains an excess of induced positive charge. Whenthe rubber rod is removed from the vicinity of the sphere (Fig. 23.3e), this in-duced positive charge remains on the ungrounded sphere. Note that the chargeremaining on the sphere is uniformly distributed over its surface because of the re-pulsive forces among the like charges. Also note that the rubber rod loses none ofits negative charge during this process.Charging an object by induction requires no contact with the body inducingthe charge. This is in contrast to charging an object by rubbing (that is, by conduc-tion), which does require contact between the two objects.A process similar to induction in conductors takes place in insulators. In mostneutral molecules, the center of positive charge coincides with the center of nega-tive charge. However, in the presence of a charged object, these centers insideeach molecule in an insulator may shift slightly, resulting in more positive chargeon one side of the molecule than on the other. This realignment of charge withinindividual molecules produces an induced charge on the surface of the insulator,as shown in Figure 23.4. Knowing about induction in insulators, you should beable to explain why a comb that has been rubbed through hair attracts bits of elec-trically neutral paper and why a balloon that has been rubbed against your cloth-ing is able to stick to an electrically neutral wall.Object A is attracted to object B. If object B is known to be positively charged, what can wesay about object A? (a) It is positively charged. (b) It is negatively charged. (c) It is electri-cally neutral.

During his lifetime, healso investigated the strengths of ma-terials and determined the forces thataffect objects on beams, thereby con-tributing to the ﬁeld of structural me-chanics.

714CHAPTER 23Electric FieldsCoulomb conﬁrmed that the electric force between two small charged spheres isproportional to the inverse square of their separation distance r—that is,The operating principle of the torsion balance is the same as that of theapparatus used by Cavendish to measure the gravitational constant (see Section14.2), with the electrically neutral spheres replaced by charged ones. The electricforce between charged spheres A and B in Figure 23.5 causes the spheres to eitherattract or repel each other, and the resulting motion causes the suspended ﬁber totwist. Because the restoring torque of the twisted ﬁber is proportional to the anglethrough which the ﬁber rotates, a measurement of this angle provides a quantita-tive measure of the electric force of attraction or repulsion. Once the spheres arecharged by rubbing, the electric force between them is very large compared withthe gravitational attraction, and so the gravitational force can be neglected.Coulomb’s experiments showed that the electric force between two stationarycharged particles•is inversely proportional to the square of the separation rbetween the particlesand directed along the line joining them;•is proportional to the product of the charges q1and q2on the two particles;•is attractive if the charges are of opposite sign and repulsive if the charges havethe same sign.From these observations, we can express Coulomb’s law as an equation givingthe magnitude of the electric force (sometimes called the Coulomb force) betweentwo point charges:(23.1)where keis a constant called the Coulomb constant.In his experiments, Coulombwas able to show that the value of the exponent of rwas 2 to within an uncertaintyof a few percent. Modern experiments have shown that the exponent is 2 to withinan uncertainty of a few parts in 1016.The value of the Coulomb constant depends on the choice of units. The SIunit of charge is the coulomb (C). The Coulomb constant ke in SI units has thevalueThis constant is also written in the formwhere the constant /H92800(lowercase Greek epsilon) is known as the permittivity of freespaceand has the value The smallest unit of charge known in nature is the charge on an electron orproton,1which has an absolute value ofTherefore, 1 C of charge is approximately equal to the charge of 6.24/H110031018elec-trons or protons.

In typical experiments in which a rubber or glass rod ischarged by friction, a net charge of the order of 10/H110026C is obtained. In otherwords, only a very small fraction of the total available charge is transferred be-tween the rod and the rubbing material.The charges and masses of the electron, proton, and neutron are given inTable 23.1.The Hydrogen Atom

THE ELECTRIC FIELDTwo ﬁeld forces have been introduced into our discussions so far — the gravita-tional force and the electric force. As pointed out earlier, ﬁeld forces can actthrough space, producing an effect even when no physical contact between the ob-jects occurs. The gravitational ﬁeld gat a point in space was deﬁned in Section14.6 to be equal to the gravitational force Fgacting on a test particle of mass mdi-vided by that mass: A similar approach to electric forces was developedby Michael Faraday and is of such practical value that we shall devote much atten-tion to it in the next several chapters. In this approach, an electric ﬁeldis said toexist in the region of space around a charged object. When another charged ob-ject enters this electric ﬁeld, an electric force acts on it. As an example, considerFigure 23.10, which shows a small positive test charge q0placed near a second ob-ject carrying a much greater positive charge Q. We deﬁne the strength (in otherwords, the magnitude) of the electric ﬁeld at the location of the test charge to bethe electric force per unit charge,or to be more speciﬁcg/H11013Fg/m.23.4horizontal and vertical directions must separately add up tozero:(1)(2)From Equation (2), we see that /H9258; thus, Tcan beT/H11005mg/cos/H9018Fy/H11005T cos /H9258/H11002mg/H110050/H9018Fx/H11005T sin /H9258/H11002Fe/H110050eliminated from Equation (1) if we make this substitution.This gives a value for the magnitude of the electric force Fe:(3)From Coulomb’s law (Eq. 23.1), the magnitude of the elec-tric force iswhere r/H110052a/H110050.026 m and is the magnitude of thecharge on each sphere.

23.4The Electric Field719
This dramatic photograph captures a lightning bolt striking a tree near some rural homes.the electric ﬁeld Eat a point in space is deﬁned as the electric force Feactingon a positive test charge q0placed at that point divided by the magnitude of thetest charge:(23.3)E/H11013Feq0Note that Eis the ﬁeld produced by some charge external to the test charge—it isnot the ﬁeld produced by the test charge itself. Also, note that the existence of anelectric ﬁeld is a property of its source. For example, every electron comes with itsown electric ﬁeld. The vector Ehas the SI units of newtons per coulomb (N/C), and, as Figure23.10 shows, its direction is the direction of the force a positive test charge experi-ences when placed in the ﬁeld. We say that an electric ﬁeld exists at a point if atest charge at rest at that point experiences an electric force.Once the mag-nitude and direction of the electric ﬁeld are known at some point, the electricforce exerted on anycharged particle placed at that point can be calculated fromDeﬁnition of electric ﬁeld720CHAPTER 23Electric Fields
Equation 23.3. Furthermore, the electric ﬁeld is said to exist at some point (evenempty space) regardless of whether a test charge is located at that point.(This is analogous to the gravitational ﬁeld set up by any object, which is said toexist at a given point regardless of whether some other object is present at thatpoint to “feel” the ﬁeld.) The electric ﬁeld magnitudes for various ﬁeld sourcesare given in Table 23.2.When using Equation 23.3, we must assume that the test charge q0is smallenough that it does not disturb the charge distribution responsible for the electricﬁeld. If a vanishingly small test charge q0is placed near a uniformly charged metal-lic sphere, as shown in Figure 23.11a, the charge on the metallic sphere, whichproduces the electric ﬁeld, remains uniformly distributed. If the test charge isgreat enough , as shown in Figure 23.11b, the charge on the metallicsphere is redistributed and the ratio of the force to the test charge is different:. That is, because of this redistribution of charge on the metallicsphere, the electric ﬁeld it sets up is different from the ﬁeld it sets up in the pres-ence of the much smaller q0.To determine the direction of an electric ﬁeld, consider a point charge qlo-cated a distance rfrom a test charge q0located at a point P, as shown in Figure23.12. According to Coulomb’s law, the force exerted by qon the test charge iswhere is a unit vector directed from qtoward q0. Because the electric ﬁeld at P,the position of the test charge, is deﬁned by we ﬁnd that at P, the elec-tric ﬁeld created by qis(23.4)If qis positive, as it is in Figure 23.12a, the electric ﬁeld is directed radially outwardfrom it. If qis negative, as it is in Figure 23.12b, the ﬁeld is directed toward it.To calculate the electric ﬁeld at a point Pdue to a group of point charges, weﬁrst calculate the electric ﬁeld vectors at Pindividually using Equation 23.4 andthen add them vectorially.

Electric Field of a Dipole
EXAMPLE23.6variation in Efor the dipole also is obtained for a distantpoint along the xaxis (see Problem 21) and for any generaldistant point.The electric dipole is a good model of many molecules,such as hydrochloric acid (HCl). As we shall see in laterchapters, neutral atoms and molecules behave as dipoleswhen placed in an external electric ﬁeld. Furthermore, manymolecules, such as HCl, are permanent dipoles. The effect ofsuch dipoles on the behavior of materials subjected to elec-tric ﬁelds is discussed in Chapter 26.An electric dipole is deﬁned as a positive charge qand anegative charge /H11002qseparated by some distance. For the di-pole shown in Figure 23.14, ﬁnd the electric ﬁeld Eat Pdueto the charges, where Pis a distance from the origin.SolutionAt P, the ﬁelds E1and E2due to the two chargesare equal in magnitude because Pis equidistant from thecharges.

Therefore, Eis parallel to the xaxis and has amagnitude equal to 2E1cos /H9258. From Figure 23.14 we see that cos Therefore,Because we can neglect a2and writeThus, we see that, at distances far from a dipole but along theperpendicular bisector of the line joining the two charges,the magnitude of the electric ﬁeld created by the dipolevaries as 1/r3, whereas the more slowly varying ﬁeld of apoint charge varies as 1/r2(see Eq. 23.4).

In such situations, the system of23.523.5Electric Field of a Continuous Charge Distribution723charges is smeared out, or continuous.That is, the system of closely spaced chargesis equivalent to a total charge that is continuously distributed along some line,over some surface, or throughout some volume.To evaluate the electric ﬁeld created by a continuous charge distribution, weuse the following procedure: First, we divide the charge distribution into small ele-ments, each of which contains a small charge /H9004q, as shown in Figure 23.15. Next,we use Equation 23.4 to calculate the electric ﬁeld due to one of these elements ata point P. Finally, we evaluate the total ﬁeld at Pdue to the charge distribution bysumming the contributions of all the charge elements (that is, by applying the su-perposition principle).The electric ﬁeld at Pdue to one element carrying charge /H9004qiswhere ris the distance from the element to point Pand is a unit vector directedfrom the charge element toward P. The total electric ﬁeld at Pdue to all elementsin the charge distribution is approximatelywhere the index irefers to the ith element in the distribution. Because the chargedistribution is approximately continuous, the total ﬁeld at Pin the limit is(23.6)where the integration is over the entire charge distribution. This is a vector opera-tion and must be treated appropriately.We illustrate this type of calculation with several examples, in which we assumethe charge is uniformly distributed on a line, on a surface, or throughout a vol-ume. When performing such calculations, it is convenient to use the concept of acharge density along with the following notations:•If a charge Qis uniformly distributed throughout a volume V, the volumecharge density/H9267is deﬁned bywhere /H9267has units of coulombs per cubic meter (C/m3).•If a charge Qis uniformly distributed on a surface of area A, the surface chargedensity/H9268(lowercase Greek sigma) is deﬁned bywhere /H9268has units of coulombs per square meter (C/m2).•If a charge Qis uniformly distributed along a line of length , the linear chargedensity/H9261is deﬁned bywhere /H9261has units of coulombs per meter (C/m)./H9261/H11013Q/H5129/H5129/H9268/H11013QA/H9267/H11013QVE/H11005ke l i m/H9004qi:0 /H20858i /H9004qiri 2 rˆi/H11005ke /H20885 dqr2 rˆ/H9004qi:0E/H11015ke /H20858i /H9004qiri 2 rˆirˆ/H9004E/H11005ke /H9004qr2 rˆA continuous charge distribution

ELECTRIC FIELD LINESA convenient way of visualizing electric ﬁeld patterns is to draw lines that followthe same direction as the electric ﬁeld vector at any point. These lines, called elec-tric ﬁeld lines,are related to the electric ﬁeld in any region of space in the fol-lowing manner:•The electric ﬁeld vector Eis tangent to the electric ﬁeld line at each point.•The number of lines per unit area through a surface perpendicular to the linesis proportional to the magnitude of the electric ﬁeld in that region. Thus, Eisgreat when the ﬁeld lines are close together and small when they are far apart.These properties are illustrated in Figure 23.19. The density of lines throughsurface A is greater than the density of lines through surface B. Therefore, theelectric ﬁeld is more intense on surface A than on surface B. Furthermore, the factthat the lines at different locations point in different directions indicates that theﬁeld is nonuniform.Representative electric ﬁeld lines for the ﬁeld due to a single positive pointcharge are shown in Figure 23.20a. Note that in this two-dimensional drawing weshow only the ﬁeld lines that lie in the plane containing the point charge. Thelines are actually directed radially outward from the charge in all directions; thus,instead of the ﬂat “wheel” of lines shown, you should picture an entire sphere oflines. Because a positive test charge placed in this ﬁeld would be repelled by thepositive point charge, the lines are directed radially away from the positive point23.611.5
This result is valid for all values of x. We can calculate theﬁeld close to the disk along the axis by assuming that ;thus, the expression in parentheses reduces to unity:/H92682/H92800E/H110152/H9266ke/H9268/H11005RWxwhere is the permittivity of free space. As weshall ﬁnd in the next chapter, we obtain the same result forthe ﬁeld created by a uniformly charged inﬁnite sheet./H92800/H110051/(4/H9266ke)

Is this visualization of the electric ﬁeld in terms of ﬁeld lines consistent withEquation 23.4, the expression we obtained for Eusing Coulomb’s law? To answerthis question, consider an imaginary spherical surface of radius rconcentric with apoint charge. From symmetry, we see that the magnitude of the electric ﬁeld is thesame everywhere on the surface of the sphere. The number of lines Nthat emergefrom the charge is equal to the number that penetrate the spherical surface.Hence, the number of lines per unit area on the sphere is N/4/H9266r2(where the sur-face area of the sphere is 4/H9266r2). Because Eis proportional to the number of linesper unit area, we see that Evaries as 1/r2; this ﬁnding is consistent with Equation23.4.As we have seen, we use electric ﬁeld lines to qualitatively describe the electricﬁeld. One problem with this model is that we always draw a ﬁnite number of linesfrom (or to) each charge. Thus, it appears as if the ﬁeld acts only in certain direc-tions; this is not true. Instead, the ﬁeld is continuous—that is, it exists at everypoint. Another problem associated with this model is the danger of gaining thewrong impression from a two-dimensional drawing of ﬁeld lines being used to de-scribe a three-dimensional situation. Be aware of these shortcomings every timeyou either draw or look at a diagram showing electric ﬁeld lines.We choose the number of ﬁeld lines starting from any positively charged ob-ject to be C/H11032qand the number of lines ending on any negatively charged object tobe where C/H11032is an arbitrary proportionality constant. Once C/H11032is chosen, thenumber of lines is ﬁxed. For example, if object 1 has charge Q1and object 2 hascharge Q2, then the ratio of number of lines is The electric ﬁeld lines for two point charges of equal magnitude but oppositesigns (an electric dipole) are shown in Figure 23.21. Because the charges are ofequal magnitude, the number of lines that begin at the positive charge must equalthe number that terminate at the negative charge. At points very near the charges,the lines are nearly radial. The high density of lines between the charges indicatesa region of strong electric ﬁeld.Figure 23.22 shows the electric ﬁeld lines in the vicinity of two equal positivepoint charges. Again, the lines are nearly radial at points close to either charge,and the same number of lines emerge from each charge because the charges areequal in magnitude. At great distances from the charges, the ﬁeld is approximatelyequal to that of a single point charge of magnitude 2q.Finally, in Figure 23.23 we sketch the electric ﬁeld lines associated with a posi-tive charge /H110012qand a negative charge /H11002q. In this case, the number of lines leav-ing /H110012qis twice the number terminating at /H11002q. Hence, only half of the lines thatleave the positive charge reach the negative charge. The remaining half terminateN2/N1/H11005Q2/Q1 .C/H11032/H20841q/H20841,•The lines must begin on a positive charge and terminate on a negativecharge.•The number of lines drawn leaving a positive charge or approaching a nega-tive charge is proportional to the magnitude of the charge.•No two ﬁeld lines can cross.charge. The electric ﬁeld lines representing the ﬁeld due to a single negative pointcharge are directed toward the charge (Fig. 23.20b). In either case, the lines arealong the radial direction and extend all the way to inﬁnity. Note that the lines be-come closer together as they approach the charge; this indicates that the strengthof the ﬁeld increases as we move toward the source charge.The rules for drawing electric ﬁeld lines are as follows:Rules for drawing electric ﬁeldlines

In this case,Newton’s second law applied to the particle givesThe acceleration of the particle is therefore(23.7)If Eis uniform (that is, constant in magnitude and direction), then the accelera-tion is constant. If the particle has a positive charge, then its acceleration is in thedirection of the electric ﬁeld.

The Cathode Ray TubeThe example we just worked describes a portion of a cathode ray tube (CRT). Thistube, illustrated in Figure 23.26, is commonly used to obtain a visual display ofelectronic information in oscilloscopes, radar systems, television receivers, andcomputer monitors. The CRT is a vacuum tube in which a beam of electrons is ac-celerated and deﬂected under the inﬂuence of electric or magnetic ﬁelds. Theelectron beam is produced by an assembly called an electron gunlocated in theneck of the tube. These electrons, if left undisturbed, travel in a straight-line pathuntil they strike the front of the CRT, the “screen,” which is coated with a materialthat emits visible light when bombarded with electrons.In an oscilloscope, the electrons are deﬂected in various directions by two setsof plates placed at right angles to each other in the neck of the tube. (A televisionSummary731
CRT steers the beam with a magnetic ﬁeld, as discussed in Chapter 29.) An exter-nal electric circuit is used to control the amount of charge present on the plates.The placing of positive charge on one horizontal plate and negative charge on theother creates an electric ﬁeld between the plates and allows the beam to besteered from side to side. The vertical deﬂection plates act in the same way, exceptthat changing the charge on them deﬂects the beam vertically.SUMMARYElectric chargeshave the following important properties:•Unlike charges attract one another, and like charges repel one another.•Charge is conserved.•Charge is quantized—that is, it exists in discrete packets that are some integralmultiple of the electronic charge.Conductorsare materials in which charges move freely.

743744CHAPTER 24Gauss’s Lawn the preceding chapter we showed how to use Coulomb’s law to calculate theelectric ﬁeld generated by a given charge distribution. In this chapter, we de-scribe Gauss’s lawand an alternative procedure for calculating electric ﬁelds.The law is based on the fact that the fundamental electrostatic force between pointcharges exhibits an inverse-square behavior. Although a consequence ofCoulomb’s law, Gauss’s law is more convenient for calculating the electric ﬁelds ofhighly symmetric charge distributions and makes possible useful qualitative rea-soning when we are dealing with complicated problems.ELECTRIC FLUXThe concept of electric ﬁeld lines is described qualitatively in Chapter 23. We nowuse the concept of electric ﬂux to treat electric ﬁeld lines in a more quantitativeway.Consider an electric ﬁeld that is uniform in both magnitude and direction, asshown in Figure 24.1. The ﬁeld lines penetrate a rectangular surface of area A,which is perpendicular to the ﬁeld. Recall from Section 23.6 that the number oflines per unit area (in other words, the line density) is proportional to the magni-tude of the electric ﬁeld. Therefore, the total number of lines penetrating the sur-face is proportional to the product EA. This product of the magnitude of the elec-tric ﬁeld Eand surface area Aperpendicular to the ﬁeld is called the electric ﬂux/H9021E(uppercase Greek phi):(24.1)From the SI units of Eand A, we see that /H9021Ehas units of newton–meters squaredper coulomb Electric ﬂux is proportional to the number of elec-tric ﬁeld lines penetrating some surface.(N/H11080m2/C)./H9021E/H11005EA24.1

Area = AEFigure 24.1Field lines repre-senting a uniform electric ﬁeldpenetrating a plane of area Aper-pendicular to the ﬁeld. The electricﬂux /H9021Ethrough this area is equalto EA.
If the surface under consideration is not perpendicular to the ﬁeld, the ﬂuxthrough it must be less than that given by Equation 24.1. We can understand thisby considering Figure 24.2, in which the normal to the surface of area Ais at anangle /H9258to the uniform electric ﬁeld. Note that the number of lines that cross thisarea Ais equal to the number that cross the area A/H11032, which is a projection of area Aaligned perpendicular to the ﬁeld. From Figure 24.2 we see that the two areas arerelated by cos /H9258. Because the ﬂux through Aequals the ﬂux through A/H11032, weA/H11032/H11005A24.1Electric Flux745
conclude that the ﬂux through Ais(24.2)From this result, we see that the ﬂux through a surface of ﬁxed area Ahas a maxi-mum value EAwhen the surface is perpendicular to the ﬁeld (in other words,when the normal to the surface is parallel to the ﬁeld, that is, in Figure24.2); the ﬂux is zero when the surface is parallel to the ﬁeld (in other words,when the normal to the surface is perpendicular to the ﬁeld, that is, We assumed a uniform electric ﬁeld in the preceding discussion. In more gen-eral situations, the electric ﬁeld may vary over a surface. Therefore, our deﬁnitionof ﬂux given by Equation 24.2 has meaning only over a small element of area.Consider a general surface divided up into a large number of small elements, eachof area /H9004A. The variation in the electric ﬁeld over one element can be neglected ifthe element is sufﬁciently small. It is convenient to deﬁne a vector /H9004Aiwhose mag-nitude represents the area of the ith element of the surface and whose direction isdeﬁned to be perpendicularto the surface element, as shown in Figure 24.3. The elec-tric ﬂux /H9004/H9021Ethrough this element iswhere we have used the deﬁnition of the scalar product of two vectorsBy summing the contributions of all elements, we obtain thetotal ﬂux through the surface.1If we let the area of each element approach zero,then the number of elements approaches inﬁnity and the sum is replaced by an in-tegral. Therefore, the general deﬁnition of electric ﬂux is(24.3)Equation 24.3 is a surface integral,which means it must be evaluated over the sur-face in question. In general, the value of /H9021Edepends both on the ﬁeld pattern andon the surface.We are often interested in evaluating the ﬂux through a closed surface,which isdeﬁned as one that divides space into an inside and an outside region, so that onecannot move from one region to the other without crossing the surface. The sur-face of a sphere, for example, is a closed surface.Consider the closed surface in Figure 24.4.

Deﬁnition of electric ﬂux

the surface and, by convention, always point outward. At the element labeled /L51832,the ﬁeld lines are crossing the surface from the inside to the outside and hence, the ﬂux ithrough this element is positive. For element /L51833,the ﬁeld lines graze the surface (perpendicular to the vector /H9004Ai); thus, and the ﬂux is zero. For elements such as /L51834, where the ﬁeld lines are crossing thesurface from outside to inside, and the ﬂux is negative because cos /H9258is negative. The netﬂux through the surface is proportional to the net num-ber of lines leaving the surface, where the net number means the number leaving thesurface minus the number entering the surface.If more lines are leaving than entering,the net ﬂux is positive. If more lines are entering than leaving, the net ﬂux is nega-tive. Using the symbol to represent an integral over a closed surface, we can writethe net ﬂux /H9021Ethrough a closed surface as(24.4)where Enrepresents the component of the electric ﬁeld normal to the surface.Evaluating the net ﬂux through a closed surface can be very cumbersome. How-ever, if the ﬁeld is normal to the surface at each point and constant in magnitude,the calculation is straightforward, as it was in Example 24.1. The next example alsoillustrates this point./H9021E/H11005/H20886 E/H11554dA/H11005/H20886 En dA/H20886180/H11034/H11022/H9258/H1102290/H11034/H9258/H1100590/H11034/H9004/H9021E/H11005E/H11554/H9004A/H9258/H1102190/H11034;∆Ai∆Ai/L51832/L51833/L51834E/L51834/L51832/L51833∆AiEθEθFigure 24.4A closed surfacein an electric ﬁeld.

24.2Gauss’s Law747
GAUSS’S LAWIn this section we describe a general relationship between the net electric ﬂuxthrough a closed surface (often called a gaussian surface) and the charge enclosedby the surface. This relationship, known as Gauss’s law,is of fundamental impor-tance in the study of electric ﬁelds.Let us again consider a positive point charge qlocated at the center of asphere of radius r, as shown in Figure 24.6. From Equation 23.4 we know that themagnitude of the electric ﬁeld everywhere on the surface of the sphere isAs noted in Example 24.1, the ﬁeld lines are directed radially outwardand hence perpendicular to the surface at every point on the surface. That is, ateach surface point, Eis parallel to the vector /H9004Airepresenting a local element ofarea /H9004Aisurrounding the surface point. Therefore,and from Equation 24.4 we ﬁnd that the net ﬂux through the gaussian surface iswhere we have moved Eoutside of the integral because, by symmetry, Eis constantover the surface and given by Furthermore, because the surface isspherical, Hence, the net ﬂux through the gaussian surface isRecalling from Section 23.3 that we can write this equation in theform(24.5)We can verify that this expression for the net ﬂux gives the same result as Example24.1: / C2/N/H11080m2)/H110051.13/H11003105 N/H11080m2/C.(8.85/H1100310/H1100212/H9021E/H11005(1.00/H1100310/H110026 C)/H9021E/H11005q/H92800ke/H110051/(4/H9266/H92800),/H9021E/H11005keqr2 (4/H9266r2)/H110054/H9266keq/H20886 dA/H11005A/H110054/H9266r2.E/H11005keq/r2./H9021E/H11005/H20886 E/H11554dA/H11005/H20886 E dA/H11005E /H20886 dAE/H11554/H9004Ai/H11005E /H9004AiE/H11005keq/r2.24.2y

Note from Equation 24.5 that the net ﬂux through the spherical surface isproportional to the charge inside. The ﬂux is independent of the radius rbecausethe area of the spherical surface is proportional to r2, whereas the electric ﬁeld isproportional to 1/r2. Thus, in the product of area and electric ﬁeld, the depen-dence on rcancels.Now consider several closed surfaces surrounding a charge q,as shown in Fig-ure 24.7. Surface S1is spherical, but surfaces S2and S3are not. From Equation24.5, the ﬂux that passes through S1has the value q//H92800. As we discussed in the pre-vious section, ﬂux is proportional to the number of electric ﬁeld lines passingthrough a surface. The construction shown in Figure 24.7 shows that the numberof lines through S1is equal to the number of lines through the nonspherical sur-faces S2and S3. Therefore, we conclude that the net ﬂux through anyclosed sur-face is independent of the shape of that surface. The net ﬂux through anyclosed surface surrounding a point charge qis given by q//H92800.Now consider a point charge located outside a closed surface of arbitraryshape, as shown in Figure 24.8. As you can see from this construction, any electricﬁeld line that enters the surface leaves the surface at another point. The numberof electric ﬁeld lines entering the surface equals the number leaving the surface.Therefore, we conclude that the net electric ﬂux through a closed surface thatsurrounds no charge is zero.If we apply this result to Example 24.2, we can eas-ily see that the net ﬂux through the cube is zero because there is no charge insidethe cube.Suppose that the charge in Example 24.1 is just outside the sphere, 1.01 m from its center.What is the total ﬂux through the sphere?Let us extend these arguments to two generalized cases: (1) that of manypoint charges and (2) that of a continuous distribution of charge. We once againuse the superposition principle, which states that the electric ﬁeld due to manycharges is the vector sum of the electric ﬁelds produced by the individualcharges. Therefore, we can express the ﬂux through any closed surface aswhere Eis the total electric ﬁeld at any point on the surface produced by the vec-tor addition of the electric ﬁelds at that point due to the individual charges./H20886 E/H11554dA/H11005/H20886 (E1/H11001E2/H11001/H11080 /H11080 /H11080)/H11554dAQuick Quiz 24.1The net electric ﬂux through aclosed surface is zero if there is nocharge insideS3S2S1q

The surface Ssurroundsonly one charge, q1; hence, the net ﬂux through Sis q1//H92800. The ﬂux through Sdue to charges q2and q3outside it is zero because each electric ﬁeld line that en-ters Sat one point leaves it at another. The surface S/H11032surrounds charges q2and q3;hence, the net ﬂux through it is Finally, the net ﬂux through surfaceS/H11033is zero because there is no charge inside this surface. That is, allthe electricﬁeld lines that enter S/H11033at one point leave at another.Gauss’s law,which is a generalization of what we have just described, statesthat the net ﬂux through anyclosed surface is(24.6)where qinrepresents the net charge inside the surface and Erepresents the elec-tric ﬁeld at any point on the surface.A formal proof of Gauss’s law is presented in Section 24.6. When using Equa-tion 24.6, you should note that although the charge qinis the net charge inside thegaussian surface, Erepresents the total electric ﬁeld,which includes contributionsfrom charges both inside and outside the surface.In principle, Gauss’s law can be solved for Eto determine the electric ﬁelddue to a system of charges or a continuous distribution of charge. In practice, how-ever, this type of solution is applicable only in a limited number of highly symmet-ric situations. As we shall see in the next section, Gauss’s law can be used to evalu-ate the electric ﬁeld for charge distributions that have spherical, cylindrical, orplanar symmetry. If one chooses the gaussian surface surrounding the charge dis-tribution carefully, the integral in Equation 24.6 can be simpliﬁed. You should alsonote that a gaussian surface is a mathematical construction and need not coincidewith any real physical surface.For a gaussian surface through which the net ﬂux is zero, the following four statementscould be true.Which of the statements must be true?(a) There are no charges inside the sur-face. (b) The net charge inside the surface is zero. (c) The electric ﬁeld is zero everywhereon the surface.

The followingexamples demonstrate ways of choosing the gaussian surface over which the sur-face integral given by Equation 24.6 can be simpliﬁed and the electric ﬁeld deter-mined. In choosing the surface, we should always take advantage of the symmetryof the charge distribution so that we can remove Efrom the integral and solve forit. The goal in this type of calculation is to determine a surface that satisﬁes one ormore of the following conditions:1. The value of the electric ﬁeld can be argued by symmetry to be constant overthe surface.2. The dot product in Equation 24.6 can be expressed as a simple algebraic prod-uct E dAbecause Eand dAare parallel.3. The dot product in Equation 24.6 is zero because Eand dAare perpendicular.4. The ﬁeld can be argued to be zero over the surface.All four of these conditions are used in examples throughout the remainder ofthis chapter.24.3
The Electric Field Due to a Point Charge
EXAMPLE24.4Starting with Gauss’s law, calculate the electric ﬁeld due to anisolated point charge q.SolutionA single charge represents the simplest possiblecharge distribution, and we use this familiar case to show howto solve for the electric ﬁeld with Gauss’s law. We choose aspherical gaussian surface of radius rcentered on the pointcharge, as shown in Figure 24.10. The electric ﬁeld due to apositive point charge is directed radially outward by symmetryand is therefore normal to the surface at every point. Thus, asin condition (2), Eis parallel to dAat each point. Therefore,and Gauss’s law givesBy symmetry, Eis constant everywhere on the surface, whichsatisﬁes condition (1), so it can be removed from the inte-gral.

This calculation israther complicated. Gauss’s law allows us to determine theseresults in a much simpler way.24.3Application of Gauss’s Law to Charged Insulators753The area of the curved surface is therefore,(24.7)Thus, we see that the electric ﬁeld due to a cylindrically sym-metric charge distribution varies as 1/r, whereas the ﬁeld ex-ternal to a spherically symmetric charge distribution varies as1/r2. Equation 24.7 was also derived in Chapter 23 (see Prob-lem 35[b]), by integration of the ﬁeld of a point charge.If the line charge in this example were of ﬁnite length,the result for Ewould not be that given by Equation 24.7.

A Nonconducting Plane of Charge
EXAMPLE24.8Because the distance from each ﬂat end of the cylinder tothe plane does not appear in Equation 24.8, we conclude thatE/H11005/H9268/2/H92800at any distance from the plane. That is, the ﬁeld isuniform everywhere.An important charge conﬁguration related to this exam-ple consists of two parallel planes, one positively charged andthe other negatively charged, and each with a surface chargedensity /H9268(see Problem 58). In this situation, the electricﬁelds due to the two planes add in the region between theplanes, resulting in a ﬁeld of magnitude /H9268//H92800, and cancelelsewhere to give a ﬁeld of zero.Find the electric ﬁeld due to a nonconducting, inﬁnite planeof positive charge with uniform surface charge density /H9268.SolutionBy symmetry, Emust be perpendicular to theplane and must have the same magnitude at all pointsequidistant from the plane. The fact that the direction of Eisaway from positive charges indicates that the direction of Eon one side of the plane must be opposite its direction on theother side, as shown in Figure 24.15. A gaussian surface thatreﬂects the symmetry is a small cylinder whose axis is perpen-dicular to the plane and whose ends each have an area Aandare equidistant from the plane. Because Eis parallel to thecurved surface—and, therefore, perpendicular to dAevery-where on the surface—condition (3) is satisﬁed and there isno contribution to the surface integral from this surface. Forthe ﬂat ends of the cylinder, conditions (1) and (2) are satis-ﬁed. The ﬂux through each end of the cylinder is EA; hence, the total ﬂux through the entire gaussian surface isjust that through the ends, Noting that the total charge inside the surface is qin/H11005/H9268A,we use Gauss’s law and ﬁnd that(24.8)/H92682/H92800E/H11005/H9021E/H110052EA/H11005qin/H92800/H11005/H9268A/H92800/H9021E/H110052EA.E++++++++++++++++ ++++ ++++++++++++++++AGaussiancylinderEFigure 24.15A cylindrical gaussian surface penetrating an inﬁ-nite plane of charge. The ﬂux is EAthrough each end of the gauss-ian surface and zero through its curved surface.the electric ﬁeld is no longer constant over the surface ofthe gaussian cylinder—the ﬁeld near the ends of the linewould be different from that far from the ends. Thus, condi-tion (1) would not be satisﬁed in this situation. Further-more, Eis not perpendicular to the cylindrical surface at allpoints—the ﬁeld vectors near the ends would have a compo-nent parallel to the line. Thus, condition (2) would not besatisﬁed. When there is insufﬁcient symmetry in the chargedistribution, as in this situation, it is necessary to use Equa-tion 23.6 to calculate E.For points close to a ﬁnite line charge and far from theends, Equation 24.7 gives a good approximation of the valueof the ﬁeld.It is left for you to show (see Problem 29) that the electricﬁeld inside a uniformly charged rod of ﬁnite radius and inﬁ-nite length is proportional to r.
CONCEPTUALEXAMPLE24.9Explain why Gauss’s law cannot be used to calculate the electric ﬁeld near an electric di-pole, a charged disk, or a triangle with a point charge at each corner.754CHAPTER 24Gauss’s LawCONDUCTORS IN ELECTROSTATIC EQUILIBRIUMAs we learned in Section 23.2, a good electrical conductor contains charges (elec-trons) that are not bound to any atom and therefore are free to move about withinthe material. When there is no net motion of charge within a conductor, the con-ductor is in electrostatic equilibrium.As we shall see, a conductor in electrosta-tic equilibrium has the following properties:1. The electric ﬁeld is zero everywhere inside the conductor.2. If an isolated conductor carries a charge, the charge resides on its surface.3. The electric ﬁeld just outside a charged conductor is perpendicular to the sur-face of the conductor and has a magnitude /H9268//H92800, where /H9268is the surface chargedensity at that point.4. On an irregularly shaped conductor, the surface charge density is greatest at lo-cations where the radius of curvature of the surface is smallest.We verify the ﬁrst three properties in the discussion that follows. The fourthproperty is presented here without further discussion so that we have a completelist of properties for conductors in electrostatic equilibrium.We can understand the ﬁrst property by considering a conducting slab placedin an external ﬁeld E(Fig. 24.16). We can argue that the electric ﬁeld inside theconductor mustbe zero under the assumption that we have electrostatic equilib-rium. If the ﬁeld were not zero, free charges in the conductor would accelerateunder the action of the ﬁeld. This motion of electrons, however, would mean thatthe conductor is not in electrostatic equilibrium. Thus, the existence of electro-static equilibrium is consistent only with a zero ﬁeld in the conductor.Let us investigate how this zero ﬁeld is accomplished. Before the external ﬁeldis applied, free electrons are uniformly distributed throughout the conductor.When the external ﬁeld is applied, the free electrons accelerate to the left in Fig-ure 24.16, causing a plane of negative charge to be present on the left surface. Themovement of electrons to the left results in a plane of positive charge on the rightsurface. These planes of charge create an additional electric ﬁeld inside the con-ductor that opposes the external ﬁeld. As the electrons move, the surface chargedensity increases until the magnitude of the internal ﬁeld equals that of the exter-nal ﬁeld, and the net result is a net ﬁeld of zero inside the conductor. The time ittakes a good conductor to reach equilibrium is of the order of 10/H1100216s, which formost purposes can be considered instantaneous.We can use Gauss’s law to verify the second property of a conductor in electro-static equilibrium. Figure 24.17 shows an arbitrarily shaped conductor. A gaussiansurface is drawn inside the conductor and can be as close to the conductor’s sur-face as we wish. As we have just shown, the electric ﬁeld everywhere inside the con-ductor is zero when it is in electrostatic equilibrium. Therefore, the electric ﬁeldmust be zero at every point on the gaussian surface, in accordance with condition(4) in Section 24.3. Thus, the net ﬂux through this gaussian surface is zero. Fromthis result and Gauss’s law, we conclude that the net charge inside the gaussian sur-24.4
Properties of a conductor inelectrostatic equilibriumSolutionThe charge distributions of all these conﬁgurations do not have sufﬁcientsymmetry to make the use of Gauss’s law practical. We cannot ﬁnd a closed surface sur-rounding any of these distributions that satisﬁes one or more of conditions (1) through(4) listed at the beginning of this section.

face is zero. Because there can be no net charge inside the gaussian surface (whichis arbitrarily close to the conductor’s surface), any net charge on the conductormust reside on its surface. Gauss’s law does not indicate how this excess chargeis distributed on the conductor’s surface.We can also use Gauss’s law to verify the third property. We draw a gaussiansurface in the shape of a small cylinder whose end faces are parallel to the surfaceof the conductor (Fig. 24.18). Part of the cylinder is just outside the conductor,and part is inside. The ﬁeld is normal to the conductor’s surface from the condi-tion of electrostatic equilibrium. (If Ehad a component parallel to the conduc-tor’s surface, the free charges would move along the surface; in such a case, theconductor would not be in equilibrium.) Thus, we satisfy condition (3) in Section24.3 for the curved part of the cylindrical gaussian surface—there is no ﬂuxthrough this part of the gaussian surface because Eis parallel to the surface.There is no ﬂux through the ﬂat face of the cylinder inside the conductor becausehere E/H110050—satisfaction of condition (4). Hence, the net ﬂux through the gauss-ian surface is that through only the ﬂat face outside the conductor, where the ﬁeldis perpendicular to the gaussian surface.

A Sphere Inside a Spherical Shell
EXAMPLE24.10SolutionFirst note that the charge distributions on boththe sphere and the shell are characterized by spherical sym-metry around their common center. To determine the elec-tric ﬁeld at various distances rfrom this center, we construct aspherical gaussian surface for each of the four regions of in-terest. Such a surface for region /L51833is shown in Figure 24.19.To ﬁnd Einside the solid sphere (region /L51832), consider aA solid conducting sphere of radius acarries a net positivecharge 2Q.

How would the electric ﬂux through a gaussian surface surrounding the shell in Example24.10 change if the solid sphere were off-center but still inside the shell?Optional SectionEXPERIMENTAL VERIFICATION OFGAUSS’S LAW AND COULOMB’S LAWWhen a net charge is placed on a conductor, the charge distributes itself on thesurface in such a way that the electric ﬁeld inside the conductor is zero. Gauss’slaw shows that there can be no net charge inside the conductor in this situation. Inthis section, we investigate an experimental veriﬁcation of the absence of thischarge.We have seen that Gauss’s law is equivalent to Equation 23.6, the expressionfor the electric ﬁeld of a distribution of charge. Because this equation arisesfrom Coulomb’s law, we can claim theoretically that Gauss’s law and Coulomb’slaw are equivalent. Hence, it is possible to test the validity of both laws by at-tempting to detect a net charge inside a conductor or, equivalently, a nonzeroelectric ﬁeld inside the conductor. If a nonzero ﬁeld is detected within the con-ductor, Gauss’s law and Coulomb’s law are invalid. Many experiments, including24.5Quick Quiz 24.3–Qrabc2Q/L51832/L51834/L51833/L51835

Because there can be nocharge inside a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium, we seethat qin/H110050; thus, on the basis of Gauss’s law and symmetry,for r/H11021a.In region /L51833—between the surface of the solid sphere andthe inner surface of the shell—we construct a sphericalgaussian surface of radius rwhere a/H11021r/H11021band note that thecharge inside this surface is /H110012Q(the charge on the solidsphere). Because of the spherical symmetry, the electric ﬁeldE1/H110050lines must be directed radially outward and be constant inmagnitude on the gaussian surface.

If we con-struct a gaussian surface of radius rwhere b/H11021r/H11021c, we seethat qinmust be zero because From this argument, weconclude that the charge on the inner surface of the spheri-cal shell must be /H110022Qto cancel the charge /H110012Qon the solidsphere.

In all reported cases, no electric ﬁeld could be de-tected inside a conductor.Here is one of the experiments that can be performed.2A positively chargedmetal ball at the end of a silk thread is lowered through a small opening into anuncharged hollow conductor that is insulated from ground (Fig. 24.20a). The pos-itively charged ball induces a negative charge on the inner wall of the hollow con-ductor, leaving an equal positive charge on the outer wall (Fig. 24.20b). The pres-ence of positive charge on the outer wall is indicated by the deﬂection of theneedle of an electrometer (a device used to measure charge and that measurescharge only on the outer surface of the conductor). The ball is then lowered andallowed to touch the inner surface of the hollow conductor (Fig. 24.20c). Chargeis transferred between the ball and the inner surface so that neither is charged af-ter contact is made. The needle deﬂection remains unchanged while this happens,indicating that the charge on the outer surface is unaffected. When the ball is re-moved, the electrometer reading remains the same (Fig. 24.20d). Furthermore,the ball is found to be uncharged; this veriﬁes that charge was transferred betweenthe ball and the inner surface of the hollow conductor. The overall effect is that the charge that was originally on the ball now appears on the hollow conduc-tor. The fact that the deﬂection of the needle on the electrometer measuring thecharge on the outer surface remained unchanged regardless of what was happen-ing inside the hollow conductor indicates that the net charge on the system alwaysresided on the outer surface of the conductor.If we now apply another positive charge to the metal ball and place it near theoutside of the conductor, it is repelled by the conductor. This demonstrates thatoutside the conductor, a ﬁnding consistent with the fact that the conductorcarries a net charge. If the charged metal ball is now lowered into the interior ofthe charged hollow conductor, it exhibits no evidence of an electric force. Thisshows that E/H110050 inside the hollow conductor.This experiment veriﬁes the predictions of Gauss’s law and therefore veriﬁesCoulomb’s law. The equivalence of Gauss’s law and Coulomb’s law is due to theinverse-square behavior of the electric force. Thus, we can interpret this experi-ment as verifying the exponent of 2 in the 1/r2behavior of the electric force. Ex-periments by Williams, Faller, and Hill in 1971 showed that the exponent of rinCoulomb’s law is (2/H11001/H9254), where In the experiment we have described, the charged ball hanging in the hollowconductor would show no deﬂection even in the case in which an external electricﬁeld is applied to the entire system. The ﬁeld inside the conductor is still zero.This ability of conductors to “block” external electric ﬁelds is utilized in manyplaces, from electromagnetic shielding for computer components to thin metalcoatings on the glass in airport control towers to keep radar originating outsidethe tower from disrupting the electronics inside. Cellular telephone users ridingtrains like the one pictured at the beginning of the chapter have to speak loudly tobe heard above the noise of the train. In response to complaints from other pas-sengers, the train companies are considering coating the windows with a thinmetallic conductor. This coating, combined with the metal frame of the train car,blocks cellular telephone transmissions into and out of the train./H9254/H11005(2.7/H110063.1)/H1100310/H1100216!E/HS110050

The dimensionless unit of a solid angle is the steradian.(You maywant to compare this equation to Equation 10.1b, the deﬁnition of the radian.) Be-cause the surface area of a sphere is 4/H9266r2, the total solid angle subtended by thesphere isNow consider a point chargeqsurrounded by a closed surface of arbitraryshape (Fig. 24.21). The total electric ﬂux through this surface can be obtained byevaluating for each small area element /H9004A and summing over all elements.The ﬂux through each element iswhere ris the distance from the charge to the area element, /H9258is the angle betweenthe electric ﬁeld Eand /H9004Afor the element, and for a point charge. InFigure 24.22, we see that the projection of the area element perpendicular to theradius vector is /H9004Acos /H9258. Thus, the quantity /H9004Acos /H9258/r2is equal to the solid angle/H9004/H9024that the surface element /H9004A subtends at the charge q. We also see that /H9004/H9024isequal to the solid angle subtended by the area element of a spherical surface of ra-dius r.

The electric ﬁeld is zero everywhere inside the conductor.2. Any net charge on the conductor resides entirely on its surface.3. The electric ﬁeld just outside the conductor is perpendicular to its surface andhas a magnitude /H9268//H92800, where /H9268is the surface charge density at that point.4. On an irregularly shaped conductor, the surface charge density is greatestwhere the radius of curvature of the surface is the smallest.Problem-Solving HintsGauss’s law, as we have seen, is very powerful in solving problems involvinghighly symmetric charge distributions. In this chapter, you encountered threekinds of symmetry: planar, cylindrical, and spherical. It is important to reviewExamples 24.4 through 24.10 and to adhere to the following procedure whenusing Gauss’s law:•Select a gaussian surface that has a symmetry to match that of the chargedistribution and satisﬁes one or more of the conditions listed in Section24.3. For point charges or spherically symmetric charge distributions, thegaussian surface should be a sphere centered on the charge as in Examples24.4, 24.5, 24.6, and 24.10. For uniform line charges or uniformly chargedcylinders, your gaussian surface should be a cylindrical surface that is coax-ial with the line charge or cylinder as in Example 24.7. For planes of charge,a useful choice is a cylindrical gaussian surface that straddles the plane, asshown in Example 24.8. These choices enable you to simplify the surface in-tegral that appears in Gauss’s law and represents the total electric ﬂuxthrough that surface.•Evaluate the qin//H92800term in Gauss’s law, which amounts to calculating the to-tal electric charge qininside the gaussian surface. If the charge density isuniform (that is, if /H9261, /H9268, or /H9267is constant), simply multiply that charge densityby the length, area, or volume enclosed by the gaussian surface. If thecharge distribution is nonuniform,integrate the charge density over the re-gion enclosed by the gaussian surface. For example, if the charge is distrib-uted along a line, integrate the expression where dqis the chargeon an inﬁnitesimal length element dx. For a plane of charge, integratewhere dAis an inﬁnitesimal element of area. For a volume ofcharge, integrate where dVis an inﬁnitesimal element of volume.•Once the terms in Gauss’s law have been evaluated, solve for the electricﬁeld on the gaussian surface if the charge distribution is given in the prob-lem. Conversely, if the electric ﬁeld is known, calculate the charge distribu-tion that produces the ﬁeld.dq/H11005/H9267 dV,dq/H11005/H9268 dA,dq/H11005/H9261 dx,QUESTIONS3.If more electric ﬁeld lines are leaving a gaussian surfacethan entering, what can you conclude about the netcharge enclosed by that surface?4.A uniform electric ﬁeld exists in a region of space inwhich there are no charges.

76825.1Potential Difference and Electric Potential769he concept of potential energy was introduced in Chapter 8 in connectionwith such conservative forces as the force of gravity and the elastic force exertedby a spring. By using the law of conservation of energy, we were able to avoidworking directly with forces when solving various problems in mechanics. In thischapter we see that the concept of potential energy is also of great value in thestudy of electricity. Because the electrostatic force given by Coulomb’s law is con-servative, electrostatic phenomena can be conveniently described in terms of anelectric potential energy. This idea enables us to deﬁne a scalar quantity known aselectric potential.Because the electric potential at any point in an electric ﬁeld is ascalar function, we can use it to describe electrostatic phenomena more simplythan if we were to rely only on the concepts of the electric ﬁeld and electric forces.In later chapters we shall see that the concept of electric potential is of great prac-tical value.POTENTIAL DIFFERENCE AND ELECTRIC POTENTIALWhen a test charge q0is placed in an electric ﬁeld Ecreated by some othercharged object, the electric force acting on the test charge is q0E. (If the ﬁeld isproduced by more than one charged object, this force acting on the test charge isthe vector sum of the individual forces exerted on it by the various other chargedobjects.) The force q0Eis conservative because the individual forces described byCoulomb’s law are conservative. When the test charge is moved in the ﬁeld bysome external agent, the work done by the ﬁeld on the charge is equal to the neg-ative of the work done by the external agent causing the displacement. For an in-ﬁnitesimal displacement ds, the work done by the electric ﬁeld on the charge isAs this amount of work is done by the ﬁeld, the potential energyof the charge–ﬁeld system is decreased by an amount For a ﬁnitedisplacement of the charge from a point Ato a point B, the change in potentialenergy of the system is(25.1)The integration is performed along the path that q0follows as it moves from AtoB, and the integral is called either a path integral or a line integral (the two terms aresynonymous). Because the force q0Eis conservative, this line integral does notdepend on the path taken from Ato B.If the path between Aand Bdoes not make any difference in Equation 25.1, why don’t wejust use the expression where dis the straight-line distance between Aand B?The potential energy per unit charge U/q0is independent of the value of q0and has a unique value at every point in an electric ﬁeld. This quantity U/q0iscalled the electric potential(or simply the potential) V. Thus, the electric poten-tial at any point in an electric ﬁeld is(25.2)V/H11005Uq0/H9004U/H11005/H11002q0Ed,Quick Quiz 25.1/H9004U/H11005/H11002q0 /H20885BA E/H11554ds/H9004U/H11005UB/H11002UAdU/H11005/H11002q0E/H11554ds.F/H11554ds/H11005q0E/H11554ds.25.1T
Change in potential energy11.8
The fact that potential energy is a scalar quantity means that electric potential alsois a scalar quantity.The potential differencebetween any two points Aand Bin anelectric ﬁeld is deﬁned as the change in potential energy of the system divided bythe test charge q0:(25.3)Potential difference should not be confused with difference in potential energy.The potential difference is proportional to the change in potential energy, and wesee from Equation 25.3 that the two are related by Electric potential is a scalar characteristic of an electric ﬁeld, indepen-dent of the charges that may be placed in the ﬁeld. However, when we speakof potential energy, we are referring to the charge–ﬁeld system.Because weare usually interested in knowing the electric potential at the location of a chargeand the potential energy resulting from the interaction of the charge with theﬁeld, we follow the common convention of speaking of the potential energy as if itbelonged to the charge.Because the change in potential energy of a charge is the negative of the workdone by the electric ﬁeld on the charge (as noted in Equation 25.1), the potentialdifference /H9004Vbetween points Aand Bequals the work per unit charge that an ex-ternal agent must perform to move a test charge from Ato Bwithout changing thekinetic energy of the test charge.Just as with potential energy, only differences in electric potential are meaning-ful. To avoid having to work with potential differences, however, we often take thevalue of the electric potential to be zero at some convenient point in an electricﬁeld. This is what we do here: arbitrarily establish the electric potential to be zeroat a point that is inﬁnitely remote from the charges producing the ﬁeld. Havingmade this choice, we can state that the electric potential at an arbitrary pointin an electric ﬁeld equals the work required per unit charge to bring a posi-tive test charge from inﬁnity to that point.Thus, if we take point Ain Equation25.3 to be at inﬁnity, the electric potential at any point Pis(25.4)In reality, VPrepresents the potential difference /H9004Vbetween the point Pand apoint at inﬁnity. (Eq. 25.4 is a special case of Eq. 25.3.)Because electric potential is a measure of potential energy per unit charge, theSI unit of both electric potential and potential difference is joules per coulomb,which is deﬁned as a volt(V):That is, 1 J of work must be done to move a 1-C charge through a potential differ-ence of 1 V.Equation 25.3 shows that potential difference also has units of electric ﬁeldtimes distance. From this, it follows that the SI unit of electric ﬁeld (N/C) can alsobe expressed in volts per meter:1 NC/H110051 Vm1 V/H110131 JCVP/H11005/H11002/H20885P/H11009 E/H11554ds/H9004U/H11005q0/H9004V./H9004V/H11005/H9004Uq0/H11005/H11002/H20885BA E/H11554ds/H9004V/H11005VB/H11002VA770CHAPTER 25Electric Potential
Potential difference
Deﬁnition of volt25.2Potential Differences in a Uniform Electric Field771A unit of energy commonly used in atomic and nuclear physics is the electronvolt (eV), which is deﬁned asthe energy an electron (or proton) gains or losesby moving through a potential difference of 1 V .Because 1 V/H110051J / C  a n d  b e -cause the fundamental charge is approximately the electron volt isrelated to the joule as follows:(25.5)For instance, an electron in the beam of a typical television picture tube may havea speed of 3.5/H11003107m/s. This corresponds to a kinetic energy of 5.6/H1100310/H1100216J,which is equivalent to 3.5/H11003103eV. Such an electron has to be accelerated fromrest through a potential difference of 3.5 kV to reach this speed.POTENTIAL DIFFERENCES IN AUNIFORM ELECTRIC FIELDEquations 25.1 and 25.3 hold in all electric ﬁelds, whether uniform or varying, butthey can be simpliﬁed for a uniform ﬁeld. First, consider a uniform electric ﬁelddirected along the negative yaxis, as shown in Figure 25.1a. Let us calculate thepotential difference between two points Aand Bseparated by a distance d, wheredis measured parallel to the ﬁeld lines. Equation 25.3 givesBecause Eis constant, we can remove it from the integral sign; this gives(25.6)The minus sign indicates that point Bis at a lower electric potential than point A;that is, Electric ﬁeld lines always point in the direction of decreas-ing electric potential,as shown in Figure 25.1a.Now suppose that a test charge q0moves from Ato B. We can calculate thechange in its potential energy from Equations 25.3 and 25.6:(25.7)/H9004U/H11005q0 /H9004V/H11005/H11002q0EdVB/H11021VA ./H9004V/H11005/H11002E /H20885BA ds/H11005/H11002EdVB/H11002VA/H11005/H9004V/H11005/H11002/H20885BA E/H11554ds/H11005/H11002/H20885BA E cos 0/H11034 ds/H11005/H11002/H20885BA E ds25.21 eV/H110051.60/H1100310/H1100219 C/H11080V/H110051.60/H1100310/H1100219 J1.60/H1100310/H1100219 C,

Potential difference in a uniformelectric ﬁeld772CHAPTER 25Electric PotentialFrom this result, we see that if q0is positive, then /H9004Uis negative. We conclude thata positive charge loses electric potential energy when it moves in the direc-tion of the electric ﬁeld.This means that an electric ﬁeld does work on a positivecharge when the charge moves in the direction of the electric ﬁeld. (This is analo-gous to the work done by the gravitational ﬁeld on a falling mass, as shown in Fig-ure 25.1b.) If a positive test charge is released from rest in this electric ﬁeld, it ex-periences an electric force q0Ein the direction of E(downward in Fig. 25.1a).Therefore, it accelerates downward, gaining kinetic energy. As the charged parti-cle gains kinetic energy, it loses an equal amount of potential energy.If q0is negative, then /H9004Uis positive and the situation is reversed: A negativecharge gains electric potential energy when it moves in the direction of theelectric ﬁeld.If a negative charge is released from rest in the ﬁeld E, it acceler-ates in a direction opposite the direction of the ﬁeld.Now consider the more general case of a charged particle that is free to movebetween any two points in a uniform electric ﬁeld directed along the xaxis, asshown in Figure 25.2. (In this situation, the charge is not being moved by an exter-nal agent as before.) If srepresents the displacement vector between points AandB, Equation 25.3 gives(25.8)where again we are able to remove Efrom the integral because it is constant. Thechange in potential energy of the charge is(25.9)Finally, we conclude from Equation 25.8 that all points in a plane perpendicu-lar to a uniform electric ﬁeld are at the same electric potential. We can see this inFigure 25.2, where the potential difference is equal to the potential differ-ence (Prove this to yourself by working out the dot product forwhere the angle /H9258between Eand sis arbitrary as shown in Figure 25.2, andthe dot product for where /H9258/H110050.) Therefore, The name equipo-tential surface is given to any surface consisting of a continuous distribu-tion of points having the same electric potential.Note that because no work is done in moving a test charge be-tween any two points on an equipotential surface. The equipotential surfaces of auniform electric ﬁeld consist of a family of planes that are all perpendicular to theﬁeld. Equipotential surfaces for ﬁelds with other symmetries are described in latersections.The labeled points in Figure 25.3 are on a series of equipotential surfaces associated with anelectric ﬁeld.

25.2Potential Differences in a Uniform Electric Field773The Electric Field Between Two Parallel Plates of Opposite Charge
EXAMPLE25.1A battery produces a speciﬁed potential difference betweenconductors attached to the battery terminals. A 12-V batteryis connected between two parallel plates, as shown in Figure25.4. The separation between the plates is d/H110050.30 cm, andwe assume the electric ﬁeld between the plates to be uniform.
1The electric ﬁeld vanishes within a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium; thus, the path integralbetween any two points in the conductor must be zero. A more complete discussion of thispoint is given in Section 25.6./H20885 E/H11554ds+–12 VABdFigure 25.4A 12-V battery connected to two parallel plates. Theelectric ﬁeld between the plates has a magnitude given by the poten-tial difference /H9004Vdivided by the plate separation d.(This assumption is reasonable if the plate separation is smallrelative to the plate dimensions and if we do not considerpoints near the plate edges.) Find the magnitude of the elec-tric ﬁeld between the plates.SolutionThe electric ﬁeld is directed from the positiveplate (A) to the negative one (B), and the positive plate is ata higher electric potential than the negative plate is. The po-tential difference between the plates must equal the potentialdifference between the battery terminals. We can understandthis by noting that all points on a conductor in equilibriumare at the same electric potential1; no potential difference ex-ists between a terminal and any portion of the plate to whichit is connected. Therefore, the magnitude of the electric ﬁeldbetween the plates is, from Equation 25.6,This conﬁguration, which is shown in Figure 25.4 andcalled a parallel-plate capacitor,is examined in greater detail inChapter 26.4.0/H11003103 V/mE/H11005/H20841VB/H11002VA/H20841d/H1100512 V0.30/H1100310/H110022 m/H11005Motion of a Proton in a Uniform Electric Field

Recall that such a charge produces anelectric ﬁeld that is directed radially outward from the charge. To ﬁnd the electricpotential at a point located a distance rfrom the charge, we begin with the gen-eral expression for potential difference:where Aand Bare the two arbitrary points shown in Figure 25.6. At any ﬁeldpoint, the electric ﬁeld due to the point charge is (Eq. 23.4), where is a unit vector directed from the charge toward the ﬁeld point. The quantity can be expressed asBecause the magnitude of is 1, the dot product where /H9258is the angle between and ds. Furthermore, dscos /H9258 is the projection of dsonto r; thus, dscos /H9258/H11005dr. That is, any displacement dsalong the path frompoint Ato point Bproduces a change drin the magnitude of r, the radial distance to the charge creating the ﬁeld. Making these substitutions, we ﬁnd that hence, the expression for the potential difference be-comes(25.10)The integral of is independent of the path between points Aand B—as it mustbe because the electric ﬁeld of a point charge is conservative. Furthermore, Equa-tion 25.10 expresses the important result that the potential difference between anytwo points Aand Bin a ﬁeld created by a point charge depends only on the radialcoordinates rAand rB. It is customary to choose the reference of electric potentialto be zero at With this reference, the electric potential created by a pointcharge at any distance rfrom the charge is(25.11)Electric potential is graphed in Figure 25.7 as a function of r, the radial dis-tance from a positive charge in the xyplane. Consider the following analogy togravitational potential: Imagine trying to roll a marble toward the top of a hillshaped like Figure 25.7a. The gravitational force experienced by the marble isanalogous to the repulsive force experienced by a positively charged object as itapproaches another positively charged object. Similarly, the electric potentialgraph of the region surrounding a negative charge is analogous to a “hole” withrespect to any approaching positively charged objects. A charged object must beinﬁnitely distant from another charge before the surface is “ﬂat” and has an elec-tric potential of zero.V/H11005ke qrrA/H11005/H11009.E/H11554dsVB/H11002VA/H11005keq /H209001rB/H110021rA/H20901 VB/H11002VA/H11005/H11002 /H20885 Er dr/H11005/H11002keq /H20885rBrA drr2/H11005keqr/H20901rBrAE/H11554ds/H11005(keq/r2)dr;rˆrˆ/H11554ds/H11005ds cos /H9258,rˆE/H11554ds/H11005ke qr2 rˆ/H11554dsE/H11554dsrˆE/H11005keqrˆ/r2VB/H11002VA/H11005/H11002/H20885BA E/H11554ds25.3

These circles are cross sections of equipoten-tial spheres having the charge at the center.776CHAPTER 25Electric PotentialA spherical balloon contains a positively charged object at its center. As the balloon is in-ﬂated to a greater volume while the charged object remains at the center, does the electricpotential at the surface of the balloon increase, decrease, or remain the same? How aboutthe magnitude of the electric ﬁeld? The electric ﬂux?We obtain the electric potential resulting from two or more point charges byapplying the superposition principle. That is, the total electric potential at somepoint Pdue to several point charges is the sum of the potentials due to the individ-ual charges. For a group of point charges, we can write the total electric potentialat Pin the form(25.12)where the potential is again taken to be zero at inﬁnity and riis the distance fromthe point Pto the charge qi. Note that the sum in Equation 25.12 is an algebraicsum of scalars rather than a vector sum (which we use to calculate the electric ﬁeldof a group of charges). Thus, it is often much easier to evaluate Vthan to evaluateE. The electric potential around a dipole is illustrated in Figure 25.8.We now consider the potential energy of a system of two charged particles. IfV1is the electric potential at a point Pdue to charge q1,  then the work an externalagent must do to bring a second charge q2from inﬁnity to Pwithout accelerationis q2V1. By deﬁnition, this work equals the potential energy Uof the two-particlesystem when the particles are separated by a distance r12(Fig. 25.9). Therefore, wecan express the potential energy as2(25.13)Note that if the charges are of the same sign, Uis positive. This is consistent withthe fact that positive work must be done by an external agent on the system tobring the two charges near one another (because like charges repel). If thecharges are of opposite sign, Uis negative; this means that negative work must bedone against the attractive force between the unlike charges for them to bebrought near each other.If more than two charged particles are in the system, we can obtain the totalpotential energy by calculating Ufor every pair of charges and summing the termsalgebraically. As an example, the total potential energy of the system of threecharges shown in Figure 25.10 is(25.14)Physically, we can interpret this as follows: Imagine that q1is ﬁxed at the positionshown in Figure 25.10 but that q2and q3are at inﬁnity. The work an externalagent must do to bring q2from inﬁnity to its position near q1is whichis the ﬁrst term in Equation 25.14.

Recall from the discussion following Equation 25.8 that the electricpotential does not change for any displacement perpendicular to an electric ﬁeld.This is consistent with the notion, developed in Section 25.2, that equipotentialsurfaces are perpendicular to the ﬁeld, as shown in Figure 25.12. A small positivecharge placed at rest on an electric ﬁeld line begins to move along the direction ofEbecause that is the direction of the force exerted on the charge by the chargedistribution creating the electric ﬁeld (and hence is the direction of a). Becausethe charge starts with zero velocity, it moves in the direction of the change in ve-locity—that is, in the direction of a. In Figures 25.12a and 25.12b, a charge placedat rest in the ﬁeld will move in a straight line because its acceleration vector is al-ways parallel to its velocity vector. The magnitude of vincreases, but its directiondoes not change. The situation is different in Figure 25.12c. A positive chargeplaced at some point near the dipole ﬁrst moves in a direction parallel to Eat thatpoint. Because the direction of the electric ﬁeld is different at different locations,however, the force acting on the charge changes direction, and ais no longer par-allel to v. This causes the moving charge to change direction and speed, but itdoes not necessarily follow the electric ﬁeld lines. Recall that it is not the velocityvector but rather the acceleration vector that is proportional to force.If the charge distribution creating an electric ﬁeld has spherical symmetrysuch that the volume charge density depends only on the radial distance r, thenthe electric ﬁeld is radial. In this case, and thus we can express dVin the form dVTherefore,(25.17)For example, the electric potential of a point charge is Because Vis afunction of ronly, the potential function has spherical symmetry. Applying Equa-tion 25.17, we ﬁnd that the electric ﬁeld due to the point charge is afamiliar result.

In all cases, the equipotential surfaces are perpendicular to the electric ﬁeldlines at every point. Compare these drawings with Figures 25.2, 25.7b, and 25.8b.780CHAPTER 25Electric Potentialany direction perpendicular to r. Thus, V(like Er) is a function only of r. Again,this is consistent with the idea that equipotential surfaces are perpendicular toﬁeld lines.In this case the equipotential surfaces are a family of spheres concen-tric with the spherically symmetric charge distribution (Fig. 25.12b).The equipotential surfaces for an electric dipole are sketched in Figure25.12c. When a test charge undergoes a displacement dsalong an equipotentialsurface, then because the potential is constant along an equipotential sur-face. From Equation 25.15, then, ; thus, Emust be perpendicu-lar to the displacement along the equipotential surface. This shows that theequipotential surfaces must always be perpendicular to the electric ﬁeld lines.In general, the electric potential is a function of all three spatial coordinates.If V(r) is given in terms of the cartesian coordinates, the electric ﬁeld componentsEx, Ey, and Ezcan readily be found from V(x, y, z) as the partial derivatives3For example, if then/H11128V/H11128x/H11005/H11128/H11128x (3x2y/H11001y2/H11001yz)/H11005/H11128/H11128x (3x2y)/H110053y ddx (x2)/H110056xyV/H110053x2y/H11001y2/H11001yz,Ex/H11005/H11002/H11128V/H11128x  Ey/H11005/H11002/H11128V/H11128y  Ez/H11005/H11002/H11128V/H11128zdV/H11005/H11002E/H11554ds/H110050dV/H110050

If the charge distribution is known, we can start with Equation 25.11 forthe electric potential of a point charge. We then consider the potential due to asmall charge element dq, treating this element as a point charge (Fig. 25.14). Theelectric potential dVat some point Pdue to the charge element dqis(25.18)where ris the distance from the charge element to point P. To obtain the total po-tential at point P, we integrate Equation 25.18 to include contributions from all el-ements of the charge distribution. Because each element is, in general, a differentdistance from point Pand because keis constant, we can express Vas(25.19)In effect, we have replaced the sum in Equation 25.12 with an integral. Note thatthis expression for Vuses a particular reference: The electric potential is taken tobe zero when point Pis inﬁnitely far from the charge distribution.If the electric ﬁeld is already known from other considerations, such as Gauss’slaw, we can calculate the electric potential due to a continuous charge distributionusing Equation 25.3. If the charge distribution is highly symmetric, we ﬁrst evalu-ate Eat any point using Gauss’s law and then substitute the value obtained intoEquation 25.3 to determine the potential difference /H9004Vbetween any two points.We then choose the electric potential Vto be zero at some convenient point.We illustrate both methods with several examples.V/H11005ke /H20885 dqrdV/H11005ke dqr25.5

From Example 25.8, we know that the electric potential atthe interior and surface of the sphere must be keQ/Rrelative to inﬁnity. The po-tential outside the sphere is keQ/r. Figure 25.21b is a plot of the electric potentialas a function of r, and Figure 25.21c shows how the electric ﬁeld varies with r.When a net charge is placed on a spherical conductor, the surface charge den-sity is uniform, as indicated in Figure 25.21a. However, if the conductor is non-spherical, as in Figure 25.20, the surface charge density is high where the radius ofcurvature is small and the surface is convex (as noted in Section 24.4), and it is lowwhere the radius of curvature is small and the surface is concave. Because the elec-tric ﬁeld just outside the conductor is proportional to the surface charge density,we see that the electric ﬁeld is large near convex points having small radii ofcurvature and reaches very high values at sharp points.Figure 25.22 shows the electric ﬁeld lines around two spherical conductors:one carrying a net charge Q, and a larger one carrying zero net charge. In thiscase, the surface charge density is not uniform on either conductor. The spherehaving zero net charge has negative charges induced on its side that faces theThe surface of a chargedconductor is an equipotentialsurface786CHAPTER 25Electric Potential
charged sphere and positive charges induced on its side opposite the chargedsphere. The blue curves in the ﬁgure represent the cross-sections of the equipo-tential surfaces for this charge conﬁguration. As usual, the ﬁeld lines are perpen-dicular to the conducting surfaces at all points, and the equipotential surfaces areperpendicular to the ﬁeld lines everywhere. Trying to move a positive charge inthe region of these conductors would be like moving a marble on a hill that is ﬂaton top (representing the conductor on the left) and has another ﬂat area partwaydown the side of the hill (representing the conductor on the right).Two Connected Charged Spheres

A Cavity Within a ConductorNow consider a conductor of arbitrary shape containing a cavity as shown in Fig-ure 25.24. Let us assume that no charges are inside the cavity. In this case, theelectric ﬁeld inside the cavity must be zeroregardless of the charge distribu-tion on the outside surface of the conductor. Furthermore, the ﬁeld in the cavity iszero even if an electric ﬁeld exists outside the conductor.To prove this point, we use the fact that every point on the conductor is at thesame electric potential, and therefore any two points Aand Bon the surface of thecavity must be at the same potential. Now imagine that a ﬁeld Eexists in the cavityand evaluate the potential difference deﬁned by Equation 25.3:If Eis nonzero, we can always ﬁnd a path between Aand Bfor which is apositive number; thus, the integral must be positive. However, becausethe integral of must be zero for all paths between any twopoints on the conductor, which implies that Eis zero everywhere. This contradic-tion can be reconciled only if Eis zero inside the cavity. Thus, we conclude that acavity surrounded by conducting walls is a ﬁeld-free region as long as no chargesare inside the cavity.Corona DischargeA phenomenon known as corona discharge is often observed near a conductorsuch as a high-voltage power line. When the electric ﬁeld in the vicinity of the con-ductor is sufﬁciently strong, electrons are stripped from air molecules. This causesthe molecules to be ionized, thereby increasing the air’s ability to conduct. Theobserved glow (or corona discharge) results from the recombination of free elec-trons with the ionized air molecules. If a conductor has an irregular shape, theelectric ﬁeld can be very high near sharp points or edges of the conductor; conse-quently, the ionization process and corona discharge are most likely to occuraround such points.(a) Is it possible for the magnitude of the electric ﬁeld to be zero at a location where theelectric potential is not zero?

The electric ﬁeld in thecavity is zero, regardless of thecharge on the conductor.788CHAPTER 25Electric PotentialOptional SectionTHE MILLIKAN OIL-DROP EXPERIMENTDuring the period from 1909 to 1913, Robert Millikan performed a brilliant set ofexperiments in which he measured e, the elementary charge on an electron, anddemonstrated the quantized nature of this charge. His apparatus, diagrammed inFigure 25.25, contains two parallel metallic plates. Charged oil droplets from an at-omizer are allowed to pass through a small hole in the upper plate. A horizontallydirected light beam (not shown in the diagram) is used to illuminate the oildroplets, which are viewed through a telescope whose long axis is at right angles tothe light beam. When the droplets are viewed in this manner, they appear as shin-ing stars against a dark background, and the rate at which individual drops fall canbe determined.4Let us assume that a single drop having a mass mand carrying a charge qis be-ing viewed and that its charge is negative. If no electric ﬁeld is present between theplates, the two forces acting on the charge are the force of gravity mgacting down-ward and a viscous drag force FDacting upward as indicated in Figure 25.26a. Thedrag force is proportional to the drop’s speed. When the drop reaches its terminalspeed v, the two forces balance each other (mg/H11005FD).Now suppose that a battery connected to the plates sets up an electric ﬁeld be-tween the plates such that the upper plate is at the higher electric potential. In thiscase, a third force qEacts on the charged drop. Because qis negative and Eis di-rected downward, this electric force is directed upward, as shown in Figure 25.26b.If this force is sufﬁciently great, the drop moves upward and the drag force actsdownward. When the upward electric force qEbalances the sum of the gravita-tional force and the downward drag force the drop reaches a new terminalspeed v/H11032in the upward direction.With the ﬁeld turned on, a drop moves slowly upward, typically at rates of hun-dredths of a centimeter per second. The rate of fall in the absence of a ﬁeld iscomparable. Hence, one can follow a single droplet for hours, alternately risingand falling, by simply turning the electric ﬁeld on and off.F/H11032D ,F/H11032D25.7
4At one time, the oil droplets were termed “Millikan’s Shining Stars.” Perhaps this description has lostits popularity because of the generations of physics students who have experienced hallucinations, nearblindness, migraine headaches, and so forth, while repeating Millikan’s experiment!

For this work, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in1923.Optional SectionAPPLICATIONS OF ELECTROSTATICSThe practical application of electrostatics is represented by such devices as light-ning rods and electrostatic precipitators and by such processes as xerography andthe painting of automobiles. Scientiﬁc devices based on the principles of electro-statics include electrostatic generators, the ﬁeld-ion microscope, and ion-driverocket engines.The Van de Graaff GeneratorIn Section 24.5 we described an experiment that demonstrates a method for trans-ferring charge to a hollow conductor (the Faraday ice-pail experiment). When acharged conductor is placed in contact with the inside of a hollow conductor, allof the charge of the charged conductor is transferred to the hollow conductor. Inprinciple, the charge on the hollow conductor and its electric potential can be in-creased without limit by repetition of the process.In 1929 Robert J. Van de Graaff (1901–1967) used this principle to design andbuild an electrostatic generator. This type of generator is used extensively in nu-clear physics research. A schematic representation of the generator is given in Fig-ure 25.27. Charge is delivered continuously to a high-potential electrode by meansof a moving belt of insulating material. The high-voltage electrode is a hollow con-ductor mounted on an insulating column. The belt is charged at point Aby meansof a corona discharge between comb-like metallic needles and a grounded grid.The needles are maintained at a positive electric potential of typically 104V. Thepositive charge on the moving belt is transferred to the hollow conductor by a sec-ond comb of needles at point B. Because the electric ﬁeld inside the hollow con-ductor is negligible, the positive charge on the belt is easily transferred to the con-ductor regardless of its potential. In practice, it is possible to increase the electricpotential of the hollow conductor until electrical discharge occurs through the air.Because the “breakdown” electric ﬁeld in air is about 3/H11003106V/m, a sphere 1 min radius can be raised to a maximum potential of 3/H11003106V. The potential can beincreased further by increasing the radius of the hollow conductor and by placingthe entire system in a container ﬁlled with high-pressure gas.Van de Graaff generators can produce potential differences as large as 20 mil-lion volts. Protons accelerated through such large potential differences receiveenough energy to initiate nuclear reactions between themselves and various targetnuclei. Smaller generators are often seen in science classrooms and museums. If aperson insulated from the ground touches the sphere of a Van de Graaff genera-tor, his or her body can be brought to a high electric potential. The hair acquires anet positive charge, and each strand is repelled by all the others. The result is a25.8e/H110051.60/H1100310/H1100219 C.q/H11005ne  n/H110050,

790CHAPTER 25Electric Potentialscene such as that depicted in the photograph at the beginning of this chapter. Inaddition to being insulated from ground, the person holding the sphere is safe inthis demonstration because the total charge on the sphere is very small (on the or-der of 1/H9262C). If this amount of charge accidentally passed from the spherethrough the person to ground, the corresponding current would do no harm.The Electrostatic PrecipitatorOne important application of electrical discharge in gases is the electrostatic precipi-tator.This device removes particulate matter from combustion gases, thereby re-ducing air pollution. Precipitators are especially useful in coal-burning powerplants and in industrial operations that generate large quantities of smoke. Cur-rent systems are able to eliminate more than 99% of the ash from smoke.Figure 25.28a shows a schematic diagram of an electrostatic precipitator. Ahigh potential difference (typically 40 to 100 kV) is maintained between a wirerunning down the center of a duct and the walls of the duct, which are grounded.The wire is maintained at a negative electric potential with respect to the walls, sothe electric ﬁeld is directed toward the wire. The values of the ﬁeld near the wirebecome high enough to cause a corona discharge around the wire; the dischargeionizes some air molecules to form positive ions, electrons, and such negative ionsas O2/H11002. The air to be cleaned enters the duct and moves near the wire. As the elec-trons and negative ions created by the discharge are accelerated toward the outerwall by the electric ﬁeld, the dirt particles in the air become charged by collisionsand ion capture. Because most of the charged dirt particles are negative, they tooare drawn to the duct walls by the electric ﬁeld. When the duct is periodicallyshaken, the particles break loose and are collected at the bottom.InsulatorClean airoutWeightDirtyair inDirt out(a)(c)(b)

How is what happenshere related to the operation of anelectrostatic precipitator?
25.8Applications of Electrostatics791In addition to reducing the level of particulate matter in the atmosphere(compare Figs. 25.28b and c), the electrostatic precipitator recovers valuable mate-rials in the form of metal oxides.Xerography and Laser PrintersThe basic idea of xerography5was developed by Chester Carlson, who was granteda patent for the xerographic process in 1940. The one feature of this process thatmakes it unique is the use of a photoconductive material to form an image. (A pho-toconductor is a material that is a poor electrical conductor in the dark but that be-comes a good electrical conductor when exposed to light.)The xerographic process is illustrated in Figure 25.29a to d. First, the surface of a plate or drum that has been coated with a thin ﬁlm of photoconductive mater-ial (usually selenium or some compound of selenium) is given a positive electrosta-tic charge in the dark. An image of the page to be copied is then focused by a lensonto the charged surface. The photoconducting surface becomes conducting onlyin areas where light strikes it. In these areas, the light produces charge carriers inthe photoconductor that move the positive charge off the drum. However, positive

(b) Through the use of a light source and lens, an image is formed on the surfacein the form of positive charges. (c) The surface containing the image is covered with a negativelycharged powder, which adheres only to the image area. (d) A piece of paper is placed over thesurface and given a positive charge. This transfers the image to the paper as the negativelycharged powder particles migrate to the paper. The paper is then heat-treated to “ﬁx” the pow-der. (e) A laser printer operates similarly except the image is produced by turning a laser beamon and off as it sweeps across the selenium-coated drum.792CHAPTER 25Electric Potentialcharges remain on those areas of the photoconductor not exposed to light, leaving a latent image of the object in the form of a positive surface charge dis-tribution.Next, a negatively charged powder called a toner is dusted onto the photocon-ducting surface. The charged powder adheres only to those areas of the surfacethat contain the positively charged image. At this point, the image becomes visible.The toner (and hence the image) are then transferred to the surface of a sheet ofpositively charged paper.Finally, the toner is “ﬁxed” to the surface of the paper as the toner melts whilepassing through high-temperature rollers. This results in a permanent copy of theoriginal.A laser printer (Fig. 25.29e) operates by the same principle, with the excep-tion that a computer-directed laser beam is used to illuminate the photoconductorinstead of a lens.SUMMARYWhen a positive test charge q0is moved between points Aand Bin an electric ﬁeldE, the change in the potential energyis(25.1)The electric potentialis a scalar quantity and has units of joules percoulomb ( J/C), where The potential difference/H9004Vbetween points Aand Bin an electric ﬁeld Eisdeﬁned as(25.3)The potential difference between two points Aand Bin a uniform electricﬁeld Eis(25.6)where dis the magnitude of the displacement in the direction parallel to E.An equipotential surface is one on which all points are at the same electricpotential.

Problem-Solving HintsCalculating Electric Potential•Remember that electric potential is a scalar quantity, so components neednot be considered. Therefore, when using the superposition principle toevaluate the electric potential at a point due to a system of point charges,simply take the algebraic sum of the potentials due to the various charges.However, you must keep track of signs. The potential is positive for positivecharges, and it is negative for negative charges.•Just as with gravitational potential energy in mechanics, only changesin elec-tric potential are signiﬁcant; hence, the point where you choose the poten-TABLE 25.1Electric Potential Due to Various Charge DistributionsCharge Distribution Electric Potential LocationUniformly charged Along perpendicular centralring of radius aaxis of ring, distance xfrom ring centerUniformly charged Along perpendicular centraldisk of radius aaxis of disk, distance xfrom disk centerUniformly charged,insulatingsolidsphere of radius Rand total charge QIsolated conductingsphere of radius Rand total charge QV/H11005ke QRV/H11005ke Qrr/H11349Rr/H11022RV/H11005ke Q!x2/H11001a2

When dealing with point charges or a charge dis-tribution of ﬁnite size, we usually deﬁne V/H110050 to be at a point inﬁnitely farfrom the charges.•You can evaluate the electric potential at some point Pdue to a continuousdistribution of charge by dividing the charge distribution into inﬁnitesimalelements of charge dqlocated at a distance rfrom P. Then, treat one chargeelement as a point charge, such that the potential at Pdue to the element isObtain the total potential at Pby integrating dVover the en-tire charge distribution. In performing the integration for most problems,you must express dqand rin terms of a single variable. To simplify the inte-gration, consider the geometry involved in the problem carefully. Review Ex-amples 25.5 through 25.7 for guidance.•Another method that you can use to obtain the electric potential due to a ﬁ-nite continuous charge distribution is to start with the deﬁnition of poten-tial difference given by Equation 25.3. If you know or can easily obtain E(from Gauss’s law), then you can evaluate the line integral of An ex-ample of this method is given in Example 25.8.•Once you know the electric potential at a point, you can obtain the electricﬁeld at that point by remembering that the electric ﬁeld component in a speciﬁed direction is equal to the negative of the derivative of the electricpotential in that direction.

ANSWERS TOQUICKQUIZZESelectric potential is zero at the center of the dipole, butthe magnitude of the ﬁeld at that point is not zero. (Thetwo charges in a dipole are by deﬁnition of oppositesign; thus, the electric ﬁeld lines created by the twocharges extend from the positive to the negative chargeand do not cancel anywhere.) This is the situation wepresented in Example 25.4c, in which the equations weobtained give and .Ex/HS110050V/H11005025.1We do if the electric ﬁeld is uniform. (This is preciselywhat we do in the next section.) In general, however, anelectric ﬁeld changes from one place to another.25.2B:C, C:D, A:B, D:E. Moving from Bto Cde-creases the electric potential by 2 V, so the electric ﬁeldperforms 2 J of work on each coulomb of charge thatmoves. Moving from Cto Ddecreases the electric poten-tial by 1 V, so 1 J of work is done by the ﬁeld. It takes nowork to move the charge from Ato Bbecause the elec-tric potential does not change. Moving from Dto Ein-creases the electric potential by 1 V, and thus the ﬁelddoes /H110021J  o f  w o r k ,  j u s t  a s  r a i s i n g  a  m a s s  t o  a  h i g h e r  e l e -vation causes the gravitational ﬁeld to do negative workon the mass.25.3The electric potential decreases in inverse proportion tothe radius (see Eq. 25.11). The electric ﬁeld magnitudedecreases as the reciprocal of the radius squared (seeEq. 23.4). Because the surface area increases as r2whilethe electric ﬁeld magnitude decreases as 1/r2, the elec-tric ﬂux through the surface remains constant (see Eq. 24.1).25.4(a) Yes. Consider four equal charges placed at the cor-ners of a square. The electric potential graph for this sit-uation is shown in the ﬁgure. At the center of thesquare, the electric ﬁeld is zero because the individualﬁelds from the four charges cancel, but the potential isnot zero. This is also the situation inside a charged con-ductor.

803804CHAPTER 26Capacitance and Dielectricsn this chapter, we discuss capacitors—devices that store electric charge. Capaci-tors are commonly used in a variety of electric circuits. For instance, they areused to tune the frequency of radio receivers, as ﬁlters in power supplies, toeliminate sparking in automobile ignition systems, and as energy-storing devices inelectronic ﬂash units.A capacitor consists of two conductors separated by an insulator. We shall seethat the capacitance of a given capacitor depends on its geometry and on the ma-terial—called a dielectric—that separates the conductors.DEFINITION OF CAPACITANCEConsider two conductors carrying charges of equal magnitude but of oppositesign, as shown in Figure 26.1. Such a combination of two conductors is called a ca-pacitor.The conductors are called plates.A potential difference /H9004Vexists betweenthe conductors due to the presence of the charges. Because the unit of potentialdifference is the volt, a potential difference is often called a voltage.We shall usethis term to describe the potential difference across a circuit element or betweentwo points in space.What determines how much charge is on the plates of a capacitor for a givenvoltage? In other words, what is the capacity of the device for storing charge at aparticular value of /H9004V? Experiments show that the quantity of charge Qon a ca-pacitor1is linearly proportional to the potential difference between the conduc-tors; that is, The proportionality constant depends on the shape and sepa-ration of the conductors.2We can write this relationship as if we deﬁnecapacitance as follows:Q/H11005C /H9004VQ/H11008/H9004V.26.1
The capacitance Cof a capacitor is the ratio of the magnitude of the charge oneither conductor to the magnitude of the potential difference between them:(26.1)C/H11013Q/H9004VI
Note that by deﬁnition capacitance is always a positive quantity.Furthermore, the po-tential difference /H9004Vis always expressed in Equation 26.1 as a positive quantity. Be-cause the potential difference increases linearly with the stored charge, the ratioQ//H9004Vis constant for a given capacitor. Therefore, capacitance is a measure of acapacitor’s ability to store charge and electric potential energy.From Equation 26.1, we see that capacitance has SI units of coulombs per volt.The SI unit of capacitance is the farad (F), which was named in honor of MichaelFaraday:The farad is a very large unit of capacitance. In practice, typical devices have ca-pacitances ranging from microfarads (10/H110026F) to picofarads (10/H1100212F). For practi-cal purposes, capacitors often are labeled “mF” for microfarads and “mmF” for mi-cromicrofarads or, equivalently, “pF” for picofarads.1 F/H110051 C/VDeﬁnition of capacitance
1Although the total charge on the capacitor is zero (because there is as much excess positive chargeon one conductor as there is excess negative charge on the other), it is common practice to refer to themagnitude of the charge on either conductor as “the charge on the capacitor.”2The proportionality between /H9004Vand Qcan be proved from Coulomb’s law or by experiment.13.5
–Q+QFigure 26.1A capacitor consistsof two conductors carrying chargesof equal magnitude but oppositesign.26.2Calculating Capacitance805
Let us consider a capacitor formed from a pair of parallel plates, as shown inFigure 26.2. Each plate is connected to one terminal of a battery (not shown inFig. 26.2), which acts as a source of potential difference. If the capacitor is initiallyuncharged, the battery establishes an electric ﬁeld in the connecting wires whenthe connections are made. Let us focus on the plate connected to the negative ter-minal of the battery. The electric ﬁeld applies a force on electrons in the wire justoutside this plate; this force causes the electrons to move onto the plate. Thismovement continues until the plate, the wire, and the terminal are all at the sameelectric potential. Once this equilibrium point is attained, a potential differenceno longer exists between the terminal and the plate, and as a result no electricﬁeld is present in the wire, and the movement of electrons stops. The plate nowcarries a negative charge. A similar process occurs at the other capacitor plate,with electrons moving from the plate to the wire, leaving the plate positivelycharged. In this ﬁnal conﬁguration, the potential difference across the capacitorplates is the same as that between the terminals of the battery.Suppose that we have a capacitor rated at 4 pF. This rating means that the ca-pacitor can store 4 pC of charge for each volt of potential difference between thetwo conductors. If a 9-V battery is connected across this capacitor, one of the con-ductors ends up with a net charge of /H1100236 pC and the other ends up with a netcharge of /H1100136 pC.CALCULATING CAPACITANCEWe can calculate the capacitance of a pair of oppositely charged conductors in thefollowing manner: We assume a charge of magnitude Q, and we calculate the po-tential difference using the techniques described in the preceding chapter. Wethen use the expression to evaluate the capacitance. As we might ex-pect, we can perform this calculation relatively easily if the geometry of the capaci-tor is simple.We can calculate the capacitance of an isolated spherical conductor of radiusRand charge Qif we assume that the second conductor making up the capacitor isa concentric hollow sphere of inﬁnite radius. The electric potential of the sphereof radius Ris simply keQ/R, and setting at inﬁnity as usual, we have(26.2)This expression shows that the capacitance of an isolated charged sphere is pro-portional to its radius and is independent of both the charge on the sphere andthe potential difference.C/H11005Q/H9004V/H11005QkeQ/R/H11005Rke/H110054/H9266/H92800RV/H110050C/H11005Q//H9004V26.2QuickLabRoll some socks into balls and stuffthem into a shoebox.

A collection of capacitors used in a variety of applica-tions. d–Q+QArea = AFigure 26.2A parallel-plate ca-pacitor consists of two parallel con-ducting plates, each of area A, sepa-rated by a distance d. When thecapacitor is charged, the platescarry equal amounts of charge.One plate carries positive charge,and the other carries negativecharge.806CHAPTER 26Capacitance and DielectricsThe capacitance of a pair of conductors depends on the geometry of the con-ductors. Let us illustrate this with three familiar geometries, namely, parallelplates, concentric cylinders, and concentric spheres. In these examples, we assumethat the charged conductors are separated by a vacuum. The effect of a dielectricmaterial placed between the conductors is treated in Section 26.5.Parallel-Plate CapacitorsTwo parallel metallic plates of equal area Aare separated by a distance d, as shownin Figure 26.2. One plate carries a charge Q,and the other carries a charge /H11002Q.Let us consider how the geometry of these conductors inﬂuences the capacity ofthe combination to store charge. Recall that charges of like sign repel one an-other. As a capacitor is being charged by a battery, electrons ﬂow into the negativeplate and out of the positive plate. If the capacitor plates are large, the accumu-lated charges are able to distribute themselves over a substantial area, and theamount of charge that can be stored on a plate for a given potential difference in-creases as the plate area is increased. Thus, we expect the capacitance to be pro-portional to the plate area A.Now let us consider the region that separates the plates. If the battery has aconstant potential difference between its terminals, then the electric ﬁeld betweenthe plates must increase as dis decreased. Let us imagine that we move the platescloser together and consider the situation before any charges have had a chanceto move in response to this change. Because no charges have moved, the electricﬁeld between the plates has the same value but extends over a shorter distance.Thus, the magnitude of the potential difference between the plates (Eq.25.6) is now smaller. The difference between this new capacitor voltage and theterminal voltage of the battery now exists as a potential difference across the wiresconnecting the battery to the capacitor. This potential difference results in an elec-tric ﬁeld in the wires that drives more charge onto the plates, increasing the po-tential difference between the plates. When the potential difference between theplates again matches that of the battery, the potential difference across the wiresfalls back to zero, and the ﬂow of charge stops. Thus, moving the plates closer to-gether causes the charge on the capacitor to increase. If dis increased, the chargedecreases. As a result, we expect the device’s capacitance to be inversely propor-tional to d./H9004V/H11005Ed

(b)26.2Calculating Capacitance807We can verify these physical arguments with the following derivation. The sur-face charge density on either plate is If the plates are very close to-gether (in comparison with their length and width), we can assume that the elec-tric ﬁeld is uniform between the plates and is zero elsewhere. According to the lastparagraph of Example 24.8, the value of the electric ﬁeld between the plates isBecause the ﬁeld between the plates is uniform, the magnitude of the potentialdifference between the plates equals Ed(see Eq. 25.6); therefore,Substituting this result into Equation 26.1, we ﬁnd that the capacitance is(26.3)That is, the capacitance of a parallel-plate capacitor is proportional to thearea of its plates and inversely proportional to the plate separation,just aswe expect from our conceptual argument.A careful inspection of the electric ﬁeld lines for a parallel-plate capacitor re-veals that the ﬁeld is uniform in the central region between the plates, as shown inFigure 26.3a. However, the ﬁeld is nonuniform at the edges of the plates. Figure26.3b is a photograph of the electric ﬁeld pattern of a parallel-plate capacitor.Note the nonuniform nature of the electric ﬁeld at the ends of the plates. Suchend effects can be neglected if the plate separation is small compared with thelength of the plates.Many computer keyboard buttons are constructed of capacitors, as shown in Figure 26.4.When a key is pushed down, the soft insulator between the movable plate and the ﬁxedplate is compressed. When the key is pressed, the capacitance (a) increases, (b) decreases,or (c) changes in a way that we cannot determine because the complicated electric circuitconnected to the keyboard button may cause a change in /H9004V.Quick Quiz 26.1C/H11005/H92800AdC/H11005Q/H9004V/H11005QQd//H92800A/H9004V/H11005Ed/H11005Qd/H92800AE/H11005/H9268/H92800/H11005Q/H92800A/H9268/H11005Q/A.

EXAMPLE26.2by (b/a), a positive quantity. Aspredicted, the capacitance is proportional to the length ofthe cylinders. As we might expect, the capacitance also de-pends on the radii of the two cylindrical conductors. FromEquation 26.4, we see that the capacitance per unit length ofa combination of concentric cylindrical conductors is(26.5)An example of this type of geometric arrangement is a coaxialcable,which consists of two concentric cylindrical conductorsseparated by an insulator. The cable carries electrical signalsin the inner and outer conductors. Such a geometry is espe-cially useful for shielding the signals from any possible exter-nal inﬂuences.C/H5129/H1100512ke ln/H20898ba/H20899/H9004V/H11005/H20841Vb/H11002Va/H20841/H110052ke/H9261 lnA solid cylindrical conductor of radius aand charge Qiscoaxial with a cylindrical shell of negligible thickness, radiusand charge /H11002Q(Fig. 26.5a).

The following examples demonstratethe use of this deﬁnition to calculate the capacitance of the other familiar geome-tries that we mentioned: cylinders and spheres.26.3Combinations of Capacitors809
What is the magnitude of the electric ﬁeld in the region outside the spherical capacitor de-scribed in Example 26.3?COMBINATIONS OF CAPACITORSTwo or more capacitors often are combined in electric circuits. We can calculatethe equivalent capacitance of certain combinations using methods described inthis section. The circuit symbols for capacitors and batteries, as well as the colorcodes used for them in this text, are given in Figure 26.7. The symbol for the ca-pacitor reﬂects the geometry of the most common model for a capacitor—a pairof parallel plates. The positive terminal of the battery is at the higher potentialand is represented in the circuit symbol by the longer vertical line.Parallel CombinationTwo capacitors connected as shown in Figure 26.8a are known as a parallel combina-tion of capacitors. Figure 26.8b shows a circuit diagram for this combination of ca-pacitors. The left plates of the capacitors are connected by a conducting wire tothe positive terminal of the battery and are therefore both at the same electric po-tential as the positive terminal. Likewise, the right plates are connected to the neg-ative terminal and are therefore both at the same potential as the negative termi-nal. Thus, the individual potential differences across capacitors connected inparallel are all the same and are equal to the potential difference appliedacross the combination.In a circuit such as that shown in Figure 26.8, the voltage applied across thecombination is the terminal voltage of the battery. Situations can occur in which26.3Quick Quiz 26.2Figure 26.6A spherical capacitor consists of an inner sphere ofradius asurrounded by a concentric spherical shell of radius b.

the parallel combination is in a circuit with other circuit elements; in such situa-tions, we must determine the potential difference across the combination by ana-lyzing the entire circuit.When the capacitors are ﬁrst connected in the circuit shown in Figure 26.8,electrons are transferred between the wires and the plates; this transfer leaves theleft plates positively charged and the right plates negatively charged. The energysource for this charge transfer is the internal chemical energy stored in the bat-tery, which is converted to electric potential energy associated with the charge sep-aration. The ﬂow of charge ceases when the voltage across the capacitors is equalto that across the battery terminals. The capacitors reach their maximum chargewhen the ﬂow of charge ceases. Let us call the maximum charges on the two ca-pacitors Q1and Q2. The total charge Qstored by the two capacitors is(26.7)That is, the total charge on capacitors connected in parallel is the sum of thecharges on the individual capacitors. Because the voltages across the capacitorsare the same, the charges that they carry areSuppose that we wish to replace these two capacitors by one equivalent capacitorhaving a capacitance Ceq, as shown in Figure 26.8c. The effect this equivalent ca-pacitor has on the circuit must be exactly the same as the effect of the combina-tion of the two individual capacitors. That is, the equivalent capacitor must store Qunits of charge when connected to the battery. We can see from Figure 26.8c thatthe voltage across the equivalent capacitor also is /H9004Vbecause the equivalent capac-Q1/H11005C1 /H9004V  Q2/H11005C2 /H9004VQ/H11005Q1/H11001Q2(a)+–C2+–C1+–

Thus, for the equivalent ca-pacitor,Substituting these three relationships for charge into Equation 26.7, we haveIf we extend this treatment to three or more capacitors connected in parallel,we ﬁnd the equivalent capacitance to be(26.8)Thus, the equivalent capacitance of a parallel combination of capacitors isgreater than any of the individual capacitances.This makes sense because weare essentially combining the areas of all the capacitor plates when we connectthem with conducting wire.Series CombinationTwo capacitors connected as shown in Figure 26.9a are known as a series combina-tion of capacitors. The left plate of capacitor 1 and the right plate of capacitor 2are connected to the terminals of a battery. The other two plates are connected toeach other and to nothing else; hence, they form an isolated conductor that is ini-tially uncharged and must continue to have zero net charge. To analyze this com-bination, let us begin by considering the uncharged capacitors and follow whathappens just after a battery is connected to the circuit.

As this negative charge accumulates on the right plate of C2, an equivalentamount of negative charge is forced off the left plate of C2, and this left platetherefore has an excess positive charge. The negative charge leaving the left plateof C2travels through the connecting wire and accumulates on the right plate ofC1. As a result, all the right plates end up with a charge /H11002Q, and all the left platesend up with a charge /H11001Q. Thus, the charges on capacitors connected in seriesare the same.From Figure 26.9a, we see that the voltage /H9004Vacross the battery terminals issplit between the two capacitors:(26.9)where /H9004V1and /H9004V2are the potential differences across capacitors C1and C2, re-spectively. In general, the total potential difference across any number of ca-pacitors connected in series is the sum of the potential differences acrossthe individual capacitors.Suppose that an equivalent capacitor has the same effect on the circuit as theseries combination. After it is fully charged, the equivalent capacitor must have acharge of /H11002Qon its right plate and a charge of /H11001Qon its left plate.

ENERGY STORED IN A CHARGED CAPACITORAlmost everyone who works with electronic equipment has at some time veriﬁedthat a capacitor can store energy. If the plates of a charged capacitor are con-nected by a conductor, such as a wire, charge moves between the plates and theconnecting wire until the capacitor is uncharged. The discharge can often be ob-served as a visible spark. If you should accidentally touch the opposite plates of acharged capacitor, your ﬁngers act as a pathway for discharge, and the result is anelectric shock. The degree of shock you receive depends on the capacitance andon the voltage applied to the capacitor. Such a shock could be fatal if high voltagesare present, such as in the power supply of a television set. Because the chargescan be stored in a capacitor even when the set is turned off, unplugging the televi-sion does not make it safe to open the case and touch the components inside.Consider a parallel-plate capacitor that is initially uncharged, such that the ini-tial potential difference across the plates is zero. Now imagine that the capacitor isconnected to a battery and develops a maximum charge Q. (We assume that thecapacitor is charged slowly so that the problem can be considered as an electrosta-tic system.) When the capacitor is connected to the battery, electrons in the wirejust outside the plate connected to the negative terminal move into the plate togive it a negative charge. Electrons in the plate connected to the positive terminalmove out of the plate into the wire to give the plate a positive charge. Thus,charges move only a small distance in the wires. To calculate the energy of the capacitor, we shall assume a different process —one that does not actually occur but gives the same ﬁnal result. We can make this26.4cording to the expression /H9262F. The 2.0-/H9262F and 6.0-/H9262F capacitors also are in parallel and have anequivalent capacitance of 8.0/H9262F. Thus, the upper branch inFigure 26.10b consists of two 4.0-/H9262F capacitors in series,which combine as follows:Ceq/H1100511/2.0 /H9262F/H110052.0 /H9262F 1Ceq/H110051C1/H110011C2/H1100514.0 /H9262F/H1100114.0 /H9262F/H1100512.0 /H9262FCeq/H11005C1/H11001C2/H110054.0 The lower branch in Figure 26.10b consists of two 8.0-/H9262F ca-pacitors in series, which combine to yield an equivalent ca-pacitance of 4.0/H9262F. Finally, the 2.0-/H9262F and 4.0-/H9262F capacitorsin Figure 26.10c are in parallel and thus have an equivalentcapacitance of 6.0/H9262F.ExerciseConsider three capacitors having capacitances of3.0/H9262F, 6.0/H9262F, and 12/H9262F.

814CHAPTER 26Capacitance and Dielectricsassumption because the energy in the ﬁnal conﬁguration does not depend on theactual charge-transfer process. We imagine that we reach in and grab a smallamount of positive charge on the plate connected to the negative terminal and ap-ply a force that causes this positive charge to move over to the plate connected tothe positive terminal. Thus, we do work on the charge as we transfer it from oneplate to the other. At ﬁrst, no work is required to transfer a small amount ofcharge dqfrom one plate to the other.3However, once this charge has been trans-ferred, a small potential difference exists between the plates. Therefore, workmust be done to move additional charge through this potential difference. Asmore and more charge is transferred from one plate to the other, the potential dif-ference increases in proportion, and more work is required.Suppose that qis the charge on the capacitor at some instant during thecharging process. At the same instant, the potential difference across the capacitoris /H9004V/H11005q/C. From Section 25.2, we know that the work necessary to transfer an in-crement of charge dqfrom the plate carrying charge /H11002qto the plate carryingcharge q(which is at the higher electric potential) isThis is illustrated in Figure 26.11. The total work required to charge the capacitorfrom to some ﬁnal charge isThe work done in charging the capacitor appears as electric potential energy Ustored in the capacitor. Therefore, we can express the potential energy stored in acharged capacitor in the following forms:(26.11)This result applies to any capacitor, regardless of its geometry.

For this reason, capacitors are usuallylabeled with a maximum operating voltage.You have three capacitors and a battery. How should you combine the capacitors and thebattery in one circuit so that the capacitors will store the maximum possible energy?We can consider the energy stored in a capacitor as being stored in the elec-tric ﬁeld created between the plates as the capacitor is charged. This description isreasonable in view of the fact that the electric ﬁeld is proportional to the chargeon the capacitor. For a parallel-plate capacitor, the potential difference is relatedto the electric ﬁeld through the relationship /H9004V/H11005Ed. Furthermore, its capaci-tance is (Eq. 26.3).

This bank of capacitors stores electrical en-ergy for use in the particle accelerator atFermiLab, located outside Chicago. Be-cause the electric utility company cannotprovide a large enough burst of energy tooperate the equipment, these capacitorsare slowly charged up, and then the energyis rapidly “dumped” into the accelerator. Inthis sense, the setup is much like a ﬁre-protection water tank on top of a building.The tank collects water and stores it for sit-uations in which a lot of water is needed ina short time. 816CHAPTER 26Capacitance and DielectricsRewiring Two Charged Capacitors

Up to 360 J is stored in the electric ﬁeld of a large capacitor in a deﬁbrilla-tor when it is fully charged. The deﬁbrillator can deliver all this energy to a patientin about 2 ms. (This is roughly equivalent to 3 000 times the power output of a 60-W lightbulb!) The sudden electric shock stops the ﬁbrillation (random contrac-tions) of the heart that often accompanies heart attacks and helps to restore thecorrect rhythm.A camera’s ﬂash unit also uses a capacitor, although the total amount of en-ergy stored is much less than that stored in a deﬁbrillator. After the ﬂash unit’s ca-pacitor is charged, tripping the camera’s shutter causes the stored energy to besent through a special lightbulb that brieﬂy illuminates the subject being pho-tographed.Quick Quiz 26.5Quick Quiz 26.4

This ratio is less than unity, indicating that the ﬁnal energy is less than the initial energy. At ﬁrst, you might think thatthe law of energy conservation has been violated, but this is not the case. The “missing” energy is radiated away in the form of electromagnetic waves, as we shall see in Chap-ter 34.

Thedeﬁbrillator’s paddles are ap-plied to the patient’s chest,and an electric shock is sentthrough the chest cavity. Theaim of this technique is to re-store the heart’s normalrhythm pattern.818CHAPTER 26Capacitance and DielectricsCAPACITORS WITH DIELECTRICSA dielectric is a nonconducting material, such as rubber, glass, or waxed paper.When a dielectric is inserted between the plates of a capacitor, the capacitance in-creases. If the dielectric completely ﬁlls the space between the plates, the capaci-tance increases by a dimensionless factor /H9260, which is called the dielectric con-stant.The dielectric constant is a property of a material and varies from onematerial to another. In this section, we analyze this change in capacitance in termsof electrical parameters such as electric charge, electric ﬁeld, and potential differ-ence; in Section 26.7, we shall discuss the microscopic origin of these changes.We can perform the following experiment to illustrate the effect of a dielectricin a capacitor: Consider a parallel-plate capacitor that without a dielectric has acharge Q0and a capacitance C0. The potential difference across the capacitor isFigure 26.14a illustrates this situation. The potential difference ismeasured by a voltmeter, which we shall study in greater detail in Chapter 28. Notethat no battery is shown in the ﬁgure; also, we must assume that no charge canﬂow through an ideal voltmeter, as we shall learn in Section 28.5. Hence, there isno path by which charge can ﬂow and alter the charge on the capacitor. If a dielec-tric is now inserted between the plates, as shown in Figure 26.14b, the voltmeterindicates that the voltage between the plates decreases to a value /H9004V. The voltageswith and without the dielectric are related by the factor /H9260as follows:Because /H9004V/H11021/H9004V0, we see that Because the charge Q0on the capacitor does not change, we conclude thatthe capacitance must change to the value(26.14)That is, the capacitance increases by the factor /H9260when the dielectric completely ﬁllsthe region between the plates.4For a parallel-plate capacitor, where (Eq. 26.3), we can express the capacitance when the capacitor is ﬁlled with a di-electric as(26.15)From Equations 26.3 and 26.15, it would appear that we could make the ca-pacitance very large by decreasing d, the distance between the plates. In practice,the lowest value of dis limited by the electric discharge that could occur throughthe dielectric medium separating the plates. For any given separation d, the maxi-mum voltage that can be applied to a capacitor without causing a discharge de-pends on the dielectric strength (maximum electric ﬁeld) of the dielectric. If themagnitude of the electric ﬁeld in the dielectric exceeds the dielectric strength,then the insulating properties break down and the dielectric begins to conduct.Insulating materials have values of /H9260greater than unity and dielectric strengthsC/H11005/H9260 /H92800AdC0/H11005/H92800A/dC/H11005/H9260C0C/H11005Q0/H9004V/H11005Q0/H9004V0//H9260/H11005/H9260 Q0/H9004V0/H9260/H110221./H9004V/H11005/H9004V0/H9260/H9004V0/H11005Q0/C0 .26.5
The capacitance of a ﬁlledcapacitor is greater than that of anempty one by a factor /H9260.
4If the dielectric is introduced while the potential difference is being maintained constant by a battery,the charge increases to a value Q/H11005/H9260Q0. The additional charge is supplied by the battery, and the ca-pacitance again increases by the factor /H9260.26.5Capacitors with Dielectrics819

Types of CapacitorsCommercial capacitors are often made from metallic foil interlaced with thinsheets of either parafﬁn-impregnated paper or Mylar as the dielectric material.These alternate layers of metallic foil and dielectric are rolled into a cylinder toform a small package (Fig. 26.15a). High-voltage capacitors commonly consist of anumber of interwoven metallic plates immersed in silicone oil (Fig. 26.15b). Smallcapacitors are often constructed from ceramic materials. Variable capacitors (typi-cally 10 to 500 pF) usually consist of two interwoven sets of metallic plates, oneﬁxed and the other movable, and contain air as the dielectric.Often, an electrolytic capacitoris used to store large amounts of charge at rela-tively low voltages. This device, shown in Figure 26.15c, consists of a metallic foil incontact with an electrolyte—a solution that conducts electricity by virtue of the mo-tion of ions contained in the solution. When a voltage is applied between the foiland the electrolyte, a thin layer of metal oxide (an insulator) is formed on the foil,

Very large values of capacitance can be ob-tained in an electrolytic capacitor because the dielectric layer is very thin, and thusthe plate separation is very small.Electrolytic capacitors are not reversible as are many other capacitors—theyhave a polarity, which is indicated by positive and negative signs marked on the de-vice. When electrolytic capacitors are used in circuits, the polarity must be alignedproperly. If the polarity of the applied voltage is opposite that which is intended,the oxide layer is removed and the capacitor conducts electricity instead of storingcharge.If you have ever tried to hang a picture, you know it can be difﬁcult to locate a wooden studin which to anchor your nail or screw.

If the battery is disconnected anda slab of polystyrene is inserted between the plates, what isAnswer373 pJ.U0/H11002U  ?A parallel-plate capacitor is charged with a battery to a chargeQ0, as shown in Figure 26.17a. The battery is then removed,and a slab of material that has a dielectric constant /H9260is in-serted between the plates, as shown in Figure 26.17b. Findthe energy stored in the capacitor before and after the dielec-tric is inserted.SolutionThe energy stored in the absence of the dielec-tric is (see Eq. 26.11):After the battery is removed and the dielectric inserted, thecharge on the capacitor remains the same.Hence, the energystored in the presence of the dielectric isBut the capacitance in the presence of the dielectric isso UbecomesBecause /H9260/H110221, the ﬁnal energy is less than the initial energy.We can account for the “missing” energy by noting that thedielectric, when inserted, gets pulled into the device (see thefollowing discussion and Figure 26.18). An external agentmust do negative work to keep the dielectric from accelerat-ing. This work is simply the difference (Alternatively,the positive work done by the system on the external agent isU0/H11002U.)U/H11002U0 .U/H11005Q0 22/H9260C0/H11005U0/H9260C/H11005/H9260C0 ,U/H11005Q0 22CU0/H11005Q0 22C0
As we have seen, the energy of a capacitor not connected to a battery is low-ered when a dielectric is inserted between the plates; this means that negativework is done on the dielectric by the external agent inserting the dielectric intothe capacitor. This, in turn, implies that a force that draws it into the capacitormust be acting on the dielectric. This force originates from the nonuniform na-ture of the electric ﬁeld of the capacitor near its edges, as indicated in Figure26.18. The horizontal component of this fringe ﬁeld acts on the induced charges onthe surface of the dielectric, producing a net horizontal force directed into thespace between the capacitor plates.A fully charged parallel-plate capacitor remains connected to a battery while you slide a di-electric between the plates.

Optional SectionELECTRIC DIPOLE IN AN ELECTRIC FIELDWe have discussed the effect on the capacitance of placing a dielectric between theplates of a capacitor. In Section 26.7, we shall describe the microscopic origin ofthis effect. Before we can do so, however, we need to expand upon the discussionof the electric dipole that we began in Section 23.4 (see Example 23.6). The elec-tric dipole consists of two charges of equal magnitude but opposite sign separatedby a distance 2a, as shown in Figure 26.19. The electric dipole momentof thisconﬁguration is deﬁned as the vector pdirected from /H11002qto /H11001qalong the linejoining the charges and having magnitude 2aq:(26.16)Now suppose that an electric dipole is placed in a uniform electric ﬁeld E, asshown in Figure 26.20. We identify Eas the ﬁeld external to the dipole, distin-guishing it from the ﬁeld due to the dipole, which we discussed in Section 23.4.The ﬁeld Eis established by some other charge distribution, and we place the di-pole into this ﬁeld. Let us imagine that the dipole moment makes an angle /H9258with the ﬁeld. The electric forces acting on the two charges are equal in magnitude but op-posite in direction as shown in Figure 26.20 (each has a magnitude Thus,the net force on the dipole is zero. However, the two forces produce a net torqueon the dipole; as a result, the dipole rotates in the direction that brings the dipolemoment vector into greater alignment with the ﬁeld. The torque due to the forceon the positive charge about an axis through Oin Figure 26.20 is Fasin /H9258, where asin /H9258is the moment arm of Fabout O. This force tends to produce a clockwiserotation. The torque about Oon the negative charge also is Fasin /H9258; here again,the force tends to produce a clockwise rotation.

To do this, we recognize that work must be done by an external agentto rotate the dipole through an angle so as to cause the dipole moment vector tobecome less aligned with the ﬁeld. The work done is then stored as potential en-ergy in the system of the dipole and the external ﬁeld. The work dWrequired torotate the dipole through an angle d/H9258is (Eq. 10.22). Becauseand because the work is transformed into potential energy U, we ﬁndthat, for a rotation from /H9258ito /H9258f, the change in potential energy isThe term that contains cos /H9258iis a constant that depends on the initial orienta-tion of the dipole. It is convenient for us to choose so that cos 90°/H110050. Furthermore, let us choose at as our reference of poten-tial energy. Hence, we can express a general value of as(26.19)We can write this expression for the potential energy of a dipole in an electric ﬁeldas the dot product of the vectors pand E:(26.20)To develop a conceptual understanding of Equation 26.19, let us compare thisexpression with the expression for the potential energy of an object in the gravita-tional ﬁeld of the Earth, (see Chapter 8). The gravitational expression in-cludes a parameter associated with the object we place in the ﬁeld—its mass m.Likewise, Equation 26.19 includes a parameter of the object in the electric ﬁeld—its dipole moment p. The gravitational expression includes the magnitude of thegravitational ﬁeld g. Similarly, Equation 26.19 includes the magnitude of the elec-tric ﬁeld E. So far, these two contributions to the potential energy expressions ap-pear analogous. However, the ﬁnal contribution is somewhat different in the twocases. In the gravitational expression, the potential energy depends on how highwe lift the object, measured by h. In Equation 26.19, the potential energy dependson the angle /H9258through which we rotate the dipole. In both cases, we are making achange in the system. In the gravitational case, the change involves moving an ob-ject in a translational sense, whereas in the electrical case, the change involves mov-ing an object in a rotational sense. In both cases, however, once the change ismade, the system tends to return to the original conﬁguration when the object isreleased: the object of mass mfalls back to the ground, and the dipole begins torotate back toward the conﬁguration in which it was aligned with the ﬁeld. Thus,apart from the type of motion, the expressions for potential energy in these twocases are similar.U/H11005mghU/H11005/H11002p/H11554EU/H11005/H11002pE cos /H9258U/H11005Uf/H9258i/H1100590/H11034Ui/H110050/H9258i/H11005cos/H9258i/H1100590/H11034, /H11005pE /H20900/H11002cos /H9258/H20901/H9258f/H9258i/H11005pE(cos /H9258i/H11002cos /H9258f)Uf/H11002Ui/H11005/H20885/H9258f/H9258i /H9270 d/H9258/H11005/H20885/H9258f/H9258i p/H9005 sin /H9258 d/H9258/H11005pE /H20885/H9258f/H9258i sin /H9258 d/H9258/H9270/H11005pE sin /H9258dW/H11005/H9270 d/H9258/H9270/H11005p/H11547ETorque on an electric dipole in anexternal electric ﬁeld
Potential energy of a dipole in anelectric ﬁeld26.6Electric Dipole in an Electric Field825Molecules are said to be polarized when a separation exists between the averageposition of the negative charges and the average position of the positive charges inthe molecule. In some molecules, such as water, this condition is always present—such molecules are called polar molecules.Molecules that do not possess a per-manent polarization are called nonpolar molecules.We can understand the permanent polarization of water by inspecting thegeometry of the water molecule. In the water molecule, the oxygen atom isbonded to the hydrogen atoms such that an angle of 105° is formed between thetwo bonds (Fig. 26.21). The center of the negative charge distribution is near theoxygen atom, and the center of the positive charge distribution lies at a point mid-way along the line joining the hydrogen atoms (the point labeled/H11003in Fig. 26.21).We can model the water molecule and other polar molecules as dipoles becausethe average positions of the positive and negative charges act as point charges. As aresult, we can apply our discussion of dipoles to the behavior of polar molecules.Microwave ovens take advantage of the polar nature of the water molecule.When in operation, microwave ovens generate a rapidly changing electric ﬁeldthat causes the polar molecules to swing back and forth, absorbing energy fromthe ﬁeld in the process. Because the jostling molecules collide with each other, theenergy they absorb from the ﬁeld is converted to internal energy, which corre-sponds to an increase in temperature of the food.Another household scenario in which the dipole structure of water is ex-ploited is washing with soap and water. Grease and oil are made up of nonpolarmolecules, which are generally not attracted to water. Plain water is not very usefulfor removing this type of grime. Soap contains long molecules called surfactants.Ina long molecule, the polarity characteristics of one end of the molecule can be dif-ferent from those at the other end. In a surfactant molecule, one end acts like anonpolar molecule and the other acts like a polar molecule. The nonpolar endcan attach to a grease or oil molecule, and the polar end can attach to a water mol-ecule. Thus, the soap serves as a chain, linking the dirt and water molecules to-gether. When the water is rinsed away, the grease and oil go with it.A symmetric molecule (Fig. 26.22a) has no permanent polarization, but polar-ization can be induced by placing the molecule in an electric ﬁeld. A ﬁeld directedto the left, as shown in Figure 26.22b, would cause the center of the positivecharge distribution to shift to the left from its initial position and the center of thenegative charge distribution to shift to the right. This induced polarization is the ef-fect that predominates in most materials used as dielectrics in capacitors.The H2O Molecule

Because the poten-tial difference between the plates equals the product of the electric ﬁeld and theseparation d, the electric ﬁeld is also reduced. Thus, if E0is the electric ﬁeld with-out the dielectric, the ﬁeld in the presence of a dielectric is(26.21)Let us ﬁrst consider a dielectric made up of polar molecules placed in theelectric ﬁeld between the plates of a capacitor. The dipoles (that is, the polar mol-ecules making up the dielectric) are randomly oriented in the absence of an elec-tric ﬁeld, as shown in Figure 26.23a. When an external ﬁeld E0due to charges onthe capacitor plates is applied, a torque is exerted on the dipoles, causing them topartially align with the ﬁeld, as shown in Figure 26.23b. We can now describe thedielectric as being polarized. The degree of alignment of the molecules with theelectric ﬁeld depends on temperature and on the magnitude of the ﬁeld. In gen-eral, the alignment increases with decreasing temperature and with increasingelectric ﬁeld.If the molecules of the dielectric are nonpolar, then the electric ﬁeld due tothe plates produces some charge separation and an induced dipole moment.Theseinduced dipole moments tend to align with the external ﬁeld, and the dielectric ispolarized. Thus, we can polarize a dielectric with an external ﬁeld regardless ofwhether the molecules are polar or nonpolar.With these ideas in mind, consider a slab of dielectric material placed betweenthe plates of a capacitor so that it is in a uniform electric ﬁeld E0, as shown in Fig-ure 26.24a. The electric ﬁeld due to the plates is directed to the right and polar-izes the dielectric. The net effect on the dielectric is the formation of an inducedpositive surface charge density /H9268indon the right face and an equal negative surfacecharge density /H11002/H9268indon the left face, as shown in Figure 26.24b. These inducedsurface charges on the dielectric give rise to an induced electric ﬁeld Eindin thedirection opposite the external ﬁeld E0. Therefore, the net electric ﬁeld Ein theE/H11005E0/H9260/H900426.7

A Partially Filled Capacitor
EXAMPLE26.10SolutionIn Example 26.9, we found that we could insert ametallic slab between the plates of a capacitor and considerthe combination as two capacitors in series. The resulting ca-pacitance was independent of the location of the slab. Fur-thermore, if the thickness of the slab approaches zero, thenthe capacitance of the system approaches the capacitancewhen the slab is absent. From this, we conclude that we caninsert an inﬁnitesimally thin metallic slab anywhere betweenthe plates of a capacitor without affecting the capacitance.Thus, let us imagine sliding an inﬁnitesimally thin metallicslab along the bottom face of the dielectric shown in Figure26.27a. We can then consider this system to be the series com-bination of the two capacitors shown in Figure 26.27b: onehaving a plate separation d/3 and ﬁlled with a dielectric, andthe other having a plate separation 2d/3 and air between itsplates.From Equations 26.15 and 26.3, the two capacitances areUsing Equation 26.10 for two capacitors combined in series,we have

(b) The equivalentcircuit of the capacitor consists of two capacitors connected in series.Summary829SUMMARYA capacitorconsists of two conductors carrying charges of equal magnitude butopposite sign. The capacitance Cof any capacitor is the ratio of the charge Qoneither conductor to the potential difference /H9004Vbetween them:(26.1)This relationship can be used in situations in which any two of the three variablesare known. It is important to remember that this ratio is constant for a given con-ﬁguration of conductors because the capacitance depends only on the geometryof the conductors and not on an external source of charge or potential difference.The SI unit of capacitance is coulombs per volt, or the farad (F), andCapacitance expressions for various geometries are summarized in Table 26.2. If two or more capacitors are connected in parallel, then the potential differ-ence is the same across all of them. The equivalent capacitance of a parallel com-bination of capacitors is(26.8)If two or more capacitors are connected in series, the charge is the same on allof them, and the equivalent capacitance of the series combination is given by(26.10)These two equations enable you to simplify many electric circuits by replacing mul-tiple capacitors with a single equivalent capacitance.Work is required to charge a capacitor because the charging process is equiva-lent to the transfer of charges from one conductor at a lower electric potential toanother conductor at a higher potential. The work done in charging the capacitorto a charge Qequals the electric potential energy Ustored in the capacitor, where(26.11)U/H11005Q22C/H1100512Q /H9004V/H1100512C(/H9004V)21Ceq/H110051C1/H110011C2/H110011C3/H11001/H11080 /H11080 /H11080Ceq/H11005C1/H11001C2/H11001C3/H11001/H11080 /H11080 /H110801 F/H110051 C/V.C/H11013Q/H9004V

The increase in capac-itance is due to a decrease in the magnitude of the electric ﬁeld in the presence ofthe dielectric and to a corresponding decrease in the potential difference betweenthe plates—if we assume that the charging battery is removed from the circuit be-fore the dielectric is inserted. The decrease in the magnitude of Earises from aninternal electric ﬁeld produced by aligned dipoles in the dielectric. This internalﬁeld produced by the dipoles opposes the applied ﬁeld due to the capacitorplates, and the result is a reduction in the net electric ﬁeld.The electric dipole moment pof an electric dipole has a magnitude(26.16)The direction of the electric dipole moment vector is from the negative charge to-ward the positive charge.The torque acting on an electric dipole in a uniform electric ﬁeld Eis(26.18)The potential energy of an electric dipole in a uniform external electric ﬁeldEis(26.20)U/H11005/H11002p/H11554E/H9270/H11005p/H11547Ep/H110132aqC/H11005/H9260C0
Problem-Solving HintsCapacitors•Be careful with units. When you calculate capacitance in farads, make surethat distances are expressed in meters and that you use the SI value of /H92800.When checking consistency of units, remember that the unit for electricﬁelds can be either N/C or V/m.•When two or more capacitors are connected in parallel, the potential differ-ence across each is the same. The charge on each capacitor is proportionalto its capacitance; hence, the capacitances can be added directly to give theequivalent capacitance of the parallel combination. The equivalent capaci-tance is always larger than the individual capacitances.•When two or more capacitors are connected in series, they carry the samecharge, and the sum of the potential differences equals the total potentialdifference applied to the combination. The sum of the reciprocals of the ca-pacitances equals the reciprocal of the equivalent capacitance, which is al-ways less than the capacitance of the smallest individual capacitor.•A dielectric increases the capacitance of a capacitor by a factor /H9260(the dielec-tric constant) over its capacitance when air is between the plates.•For problems in which a battery is being connected or disconnected, notewhether modiﬁcations to the capacitor are made while it is connected to thebattery or after it has been disconnected. If the capacitor remains con-nected to the battery, the voltage across the capacitor remains unchanged(equal to the battery voltage), and the charge is proportional to the capaci-Problems831tance, although it may be modiﬁed (for instance, by the insertion of a di-electric). If you disconnect the capacitor from the battery before makingany modiﬁcations to the capacitor, then its charge remains ﬁxed.

A very good morning to all of you.

0:47
Today, we start with the first module of the course physics for class 12.

0:55
And the first module is electrostatics.

1:00
Electrostatics forms a part of a larger area of physics called electromagnetic.

1:09
So electromagnetic involves study of electric and magnetic fields.

1:14
OK.

1:15
We will start with some experiments in electrostatics.

1:20
Some of you may have carried out similar experiments at home.

1:27
But those of you who have not, I urge you to try out some of these experiments to seek excitement in physics.

1:35
So I will start with a pair of straws here.

1:38
There is one straw here, then another straw in my hand.

1:42
And what I'm going to do is I have a wool woolen scarf which I will use to rub this straw.

1:53
I rubbed the straw a couple of times.

1:56
Leave it.

1:58
I take another straw here and rub this a few times.

2:03
And then I want to see what effect it has.

2:07
You see, it's not even allowing you to touch, it's pushing the straw so much repulsion is there.

2:14
You also notice that there is nothing connecting this draw and this straw there is no string, there is no object, there's nothing connecting these two straws, but this straw seems to be pushing it.

2:25
What is happening?

2:26
Why is this pushing that?

2:27
In fact, this draw if I take to the other, I mean, why is this straw pushing the straw without any apparent connection between these two?

2:38
Let me similarly take a glass rod and rub with silk a few times and take it near the same surface.

2:49
You see it gets attracted.

2:53
This particular one repelled, it is repelling it.

2:58
This one is attracting it.

3:00
So it seems that our and this is this is getting attracted even without my touching, I get, I put close to, to the straw, it gets attracted.

3:07
So we charge it again.

3:12
Here it is, it's getting attracted.

3:15
So there seems to be two kinds of forces.

3:19
One which is repulsive between the straw and the straw is repulsive.

3:27
And another one which is attractive between this glass, which is so I buy silk and the straw.

3:37
So these experiments of attraction repulsion were carried out long long ago.

3:43
And this study of these effects is what electro static will consist of.

3:48
Now, you may have done this experiment at home.

3:51
For example, if you rub this and take it near some pieces of paper here, you see they're all getting attracted completely.

3:58
You may have seen this as effects on a comb.

4:01
If you comb your hair on a dry day, if they attract paper, they attract all other kinds of objects.

4:11
Here.

4:12
In fact, I can take this to a metal cylinder and it attracts a metal sea.

4:20
I'm not even touching the metal cylinder is attracting and moving the metal cylinder.

4:30
So what is this force?

4:35
What is happening?

4:36
Even if I do not have any contact between these two objects.

4:42
In fact, these are called the electrical effects.

4:47
You may have noticed magnets at some stage of your life.

4:54
And here are here are a pair of magnets.

4:55
As you can see here, this magnet attracts another piece, another magnet here very strongly.

5:03
In fact, if you have a metal clip, metal gets clip gets attracted, metal clip gets attracted by the magnet.

5:13
So there are two kinds of that you see here, one is between metals which are which is a different kind of effect, magnetic effect and one which is the charging effect which we have discussed here.

5:26
So all these effects constitute the general field of electromagnetism.

5:31
And in the first module, what we will discuss is electrostatics.

5:36
So having seen some interesting demonstrations of electric and magnetic effects, we will now start to study the subject in more detail.

5:51
Look at forces between charges.

5:54
Why what are the repulsive forces, what are attractive forces and so on.

5:59
As I mentioned before, this forms a very important part of the subject of electromagnetic, which has a which is one of the strongest forces in nature.

6:15
It is it dominates all atomic forces, it dominates forces which make atoms, atoms making molecules, molecules, making solids.

6:27
All these forces which are responsible are all electromagnetic in character.

6:33
So what we saw was if you rub wool with that plastic, and if you take two such rubbed plastic rods, they seem to repel each other.

6:48
So what we say is the plastic rods are getting charged.

6:52
Similarly, I showed that if I rub glass with silk, then it seems to attract the plastic rod.

7:02
So there seems to be two kind of forces, one which is repulsive in character, the other is attractive in character.

7:11
So the science of electricity and magnetism started way back in 600 BC when Greeks observed that rubbing amber with wool can attract objects.

7:26
In fact, electron has come from a Greek word which is electron, which means amber in Greek.

7:47
So the science of electricity and magnetism since that time of observation of this forces developed for centuries until 18 20 or so, when Hans Christian Oyster showed that electric forces, electric charge current can generate forces on magnetic needles.

8:11
And then beyond that point, many scientists including Michael Faraday, James Clark Maxwell integrated the fields of electricity and magnetism and we now have what the field is called electromagnetic electromagnetic.

8:25
So to explain the presence of two kinds of forces, electric repulsive and attractive forces, it seems that there are two kinds of charges, Benjamin Franklin call them by the name, negative and positive.

9:10
In fact, he could have given any pair of names to these charges, but he called them negative and positive.

9:17
And you must remember in the negative chart, there is nothing negative about it.

9:21
It's just an nomenclature.

9:24
And what I showed in the experiment are the following effects that when the two objects rippel each other, that's because both of them have a similar charge.

9:36
So what we observe is negative charges repel negative charges.

9:54
It so happens that positive charges also repel other positive charges.

10:16
And we also saw an attractive force and that is because positive charges correct negative touch us.

10:39
So this charge is actually a fundamental attribute of the particle just like mass is a fundamental attribute.

11:07
Now, if you contrast this with gravitational attraction, gravitational force, gravitational force is always attractive because there is only one kind of mass and mass attracts another mass.

11:33
While in the attribute of charges, there are two kinds of charges, positive charges, negative charges.

11:39
So positive charges attract negative charges, negative charges attract positive charges.

11:44
But if you have a positive charge and another positive charge, they will repel each other.

11:47
If you have a negative charge and another negative charge, they will repel each other.

11:53
Now, atoms consist of these positive and negative charges.

11:58
In fact, atoms are made up of primarily electrons protons and neutrons, the protons and neutrons form the nucleus and occupy a distance of about 10 to the power minus 15 m that is the nucleus.

12:18
So all the protons and neutrons are sitting within this volume and then the electrons are actually surrounding this nucleus to a radius of about 10 to the minus 10 m.

12:34
So you have the nucleus consisting of electrons protons and neutrons and you have the electrons surrounding this nucleus and the atoms, the neutral atoms have exactly the same number of electrons and protons.

12:51
So the net charge of a of a neutral atom is zero because the electrons and protons have exactly the same charge to experimental verification.

13:00
Now, both of them have exactly the same charge.

13:03
So the number of electrons being equal to the number of protons in an atom, the atom is usually neutral.

13:10
Of course, you can have situations where you can remove an electron from an atom and the atom can get positively charged because it will have an excess of positive charge compared to negative charge.

13:22
So you can have, you can ionize the atom, you can have an atom which is not neutral.

13:26
And you can, you call these ions, no chargers have very important properties.

13:36
So let's look at some of the properties of charge.

13:46
The first one is conservation of charge.

14:00
What this implies is total charge which is the sum of positive and negative charges in an isolated system, it is constant.

14:34
So isolated means you don't allow any charge to enter from outside, it's completely isolated.

14:39
So the total charge of this isolated system is a constant.

14:43
Now, it does not mean that you cannot generate charges inside.

14:47
But whenever you generate a negative charge inside the volume, you will also generate a corresponding positive charge.

14:52
So there are effects taking place in nature in which gamma radiation can split into a pair of electron positron pairs.

14:59
One is a positive charged particle, the other is a negatively charged particle.

15:03
So the total charge within that volume is remaining the same.

15:07
And this particular conservation law of charge is an experimentally valid fact.

15:18
The second one is quantization of charge.

15:30
Now this is electric charge is always found in integral multiples of a basic unit of charge which which we will call E by a small like a small e.

16:11
This is actually the charge on the electron you use the charge on the electron E is the magnitude of the charge on the electron.

16:28
And it is also the charge on the proton.

16:30
And the value of E is known to be 1.602 17, double six, 208 in 2 10 to the minus 19.

16:48
This is a unit C represents a unit which we will again come across later called the Coolum.

16:57
And this is named after the scientist Charles August in the gloom.

17:05
And so this is usually approximated as 1.6 10 to the minus 19 kum.

17:15
Now, this is an experimentally verified fact that whatever charge, you find anywhere is always an integral multiple of this number.

17:24
You cannot have a charge.

17:26
For example of 3.01 10 to the minus 19 kum.

17:30
It's not possible.

17:31
All charges will be integral multiple of this charge.

17:36
Now, this charge is a very, very small number.

17:40
So just to give you a a field for this number, if you take a one centimeter cube of copper, the metal copper, the number of electrons enhanced protons is about 2.4 inter tens power 24.

18:19
So 10 power 24 is one followed by 24 zeros.

18:22
It's a huge huge number and there are so many electrons within the volume of copper.

18:31
And for each electron, you have a proton inside copper.

18:36
If you take a standard bulb, for example, in which you are passing current and you are getting light in one second, about 10 to the 4 19 electrons are crossing.

19:01
So the electron charge is a very, very small quantity of charge.

19:09
If you look at matter, there are so many charges, so many numbers of charges that usually unless you are doing some very critical experiments at microscopic levels, it will look as if the charge is continuous.

19:22
It will look as if you can obtain any charge.

19:24
But we must remember that charge is a quest quantity and the total charge in any system has to be an integral multiple of the basic unit of charge, which is approximately 1.6 into 10 tests per minus 19 columns.

19:45
Now charges also follow principle of activity.

19:49
So I will, for example, the charge on an electron will be minus 1.6 10 to the minus 19 colum.

20:01
And the charge on a proton is plus 1.6 10 to the minus 19 cool.

20:11
So if you have a certain number of electrons and a certain number of protons, you have, you have N one electrons and N one N two protons total charge is N two minus N one into 1.6 into 10 to minus 19 cool.

20:39
So you algebraically add the charges.

20:43
So if one is equal to like in a neutral atom, the net charge on the atom is precisely zero.

20:54
No, we will see as we progress that there are different kinds of materials called conductors and insulators broadly.

21:16
So what are conductors conductors are those materials which allow free flow of electrical current in these materials?

21:41
There are electrons which are free and our able to move freely within the conductor.

22:13
So examples are metals, human body, what and so on.

22:28
And because electrons are able to move freely in these materials, if you put some charge into this into the metal, an excess charge, then the charge gets distributed over can surface.

23:00
Why surface I will come to a little later.

23:05
So the metals which we use in electrical circuits, the metals, all metals are actually good conductors and they have these electrons which can freely move within the material.

23:19
And hence, they are able to conduct electricity very well insulators.

23:26
On the other hand, do not have free electrons which can move around the material.

23:59
So they offer a hide assistance.

24:10
Two electrical currents, example, glass plastic board, et cetera.

24:36
So most material that you see are either fall into insulators or conductors.

24:42
And when you put a charge, then charge is put on an insulator, it says it stays where it, where you put it, it stays at the same place because it has no freedom to move from one point to another point within the material.

25:21
There are and other cluster materials called semiconductors whose resistance to electrical conduction is between conductors and insulators.

26:06
Examples are silicon Geum, et cetera and these actually form the backbone of the electronics industry.

26:38
They are also extremely important because using these semiconductors, one can build many electronic devices such as transistors, diodes and so on which form the basic component in most electronic circuits.

27:02
So having seen some basic facts about positive negative charges and so on, we would now like to understand what are the forces between these charges?

27:16
How do the forces?

27:17
How does the force depend on the distance between the charges?

27:21
How does the force depend on the magnitude of the charges, et cetera.

27:27
So we will start with, there was a scientist French scientist called Charles Augustine, the Kum who did a number of experiments in 17 84 to find out how the forces between charges vary as a function of separation.

28:08
How do the forces vary as a function of the magnitude of charges and so on.

28:13
So for example, he took a pair of identical charges measure the force as a function of separation between the charges for various separations kept separation fixed where is the magnitude of charges.

28:28
And from all these experiments, detailed experiments, he found out a relationship between the force, the magnitude of charges and the separation between the charges.

28:41
So the law is called Kums Law.

28:44
And this is a law which which tells the force between two point charges.

28:59
Now I must point out that point charge here implies that the size of the charge distribution is very small compared to the distance separating the two charges.

29:11
So that effectively the charge behaves like a point charge.

29:16
So if you have a, a spherical ball, which is charged if the size is a one millimeter, and if you put two charges at a separation of say 100 centimeters, this charge will almost behave like a point charge.

29:29
The law which we are, I'm going to write now is actually valid for point charges.

29:34
And it states that the force between two charge, two point charges is proportional to the individual charges.

29:42
So let me call charge, one charge is Q one, another charge is Q two and the separation between them is R So the charge, the force is proportional to the product of the two charges.

29:57
It's also proportional to one by R square, directly proportional to the product of the two charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the two charges.

30:09
And it actually the forces along the line joining the two charges.

30:16
So if I were to write the magnitude of the force, it will look something like this, some constant Q one Q two by a square.

30:25
Now let me put a sign here because as we have seen, the charges can be positive or negative.

30:32
So I'm just writing the magnitude of the force.

30:34
So Q one can be negative, Q two can be negative.

30:37
The force could be attractive force force could be repulsive.

30:40
But all the forces are described by an equation like this and K is the proportionality constant, proportionally constant.

30:58
And you have done gravitational forces before this force is very similar to the relationship or gravitational force.

31:09
But instead of charges you had masses.

31:11
And so instead of instead of distance, instead of the K has a certain value, so instead of charges, you had masses and the force of gravity is always attractive, but the electrical forces can be repulsive or attractive.

31:28
Now, the proportionally constant K is written as one by four by epsilon zero and zero is a constant referred to as permittivity of free space.

32:00
Now in one set of units, which is the si units, which is what we will be using primarily through the course K is defined exactly SK is equal to 10 to the minus seven Newton second square by cool square two C square.

32:30
The C small C, this is the velocity of light in free space and it has a definite value 2.99792458 into 10 to the power eight meters per second.

33:00
This is now a fixed value of C.

33:02
This is the value of C defined.

33:05
And so if you substitute the value of C into this equation, please remember this is a unit, it's called kum square and this C is a velocity of light in free space.

33:15
So this C is defined K is defined like this.

33:18
So I can substitute the C into this equation and get an approximate expression value for K.

33:23
And that comes out to be 8.9 88 into 10 to 49 Newton meter square by square.

33:40
So if I substitute the value of C which I wrote here, if I substitute the value of C here into this equation, and I will get a defined value, exact value of K.

33:53
And that happens to be approximately 8.998.

33:56
And usually this is written as 9 to 10.9 Newton square by square.

34:08
So this is the value which you will use.

34:10
And the definition of the, it is an SI units and the charges are defined in terms of kum, the unit of charge is a column which I defined earlier and the electronic charge is 1.6 10 to minus 19 columns.

34:32
No, that was a scalar relationship between the force of, of attraction or repulsion between two charges.

34:44
Now let me try to, because force is a vector, I need to define the actual force between two charges.

34:52
We would now like to calculate the force with direction and magnitude.

35:00
Because earlier, what I had said was only the magnitude of the force.

35:04
But I would like to also have a formula which tells me what is the direction of the force.

35:11
So for this, I will start by looking at two charges, Q one and Q two I have a and origin here.

35:24
So this vector joining origin to Q one, I will call a vector, the vector joining origin to Q two, I'll call a two vector and this vector R 21.

35:41
So R to one letter is R two vector minus R one vector.

35:49
It's a better joining Cuban to Kyoto.

35:55
So Q one and Q two or two charges can be positive or negative.

36:01
So I will define the force on this charge two Q two because of the charge Q one as F 21 is equal to one by four by epsilon zero Q one, Q 25, R 21 square into R 21 good vector.

36:22
So here R 21 unit vector is R two minus R one divided by magnitude of R two minus one.

36:36
So this is the four acting on charge Q two because of charge Q one, the manager of the force is, as we had written earlier, one by 45 sin and zero product of the two charges divided by the square of the distance between the two charges which is R 21.

36:59
So R 21 here is the magnitude or two R 21 vector.

37:05
And the direction of the force on two on Q two because of Q one is along the unit vector direction on Q one joining Q one to Q two.

37:19
Now this formula is valid no matter what charges you take what the sign of the charges is.

37:27
So for example, if both charges were positive R one R 21 unit vectors like this, both charges are positive.

37:40
So F 21 is also like this, that means the forces repulsive.

37:46
Similarly, if the first charge was negative, the second charge was negative R 21 unit vector is still like this.

37:56
And F 21 also happens to be in the same direction because both are negative and the force becomes positive with the expert to R 21 vector.

38:06
So again, it's a force of repulsion if you take one to be positive and Q two to be negative R 21 unit vector is still from 1 to 2, while F 21 becomes oppositely directed because one of the judges is positive, the other is negative.

38:27
So the magnitude of the force is in the direction of the, the force is in the opposite direction to R 21 unit vector and that force becomes attractive.

38:36
So these two forces are repulsive and this is an attractive force.

38:47
So this formula is a formula which tells me the magnitude and direction of the electrostatic force between two charges.

38:58
Q one and Q two, the force is proportional to the product of the two charges is mostly proportional to the square of the distance separating the two charges and is along a direction joining Q one to Q two, where I'm writing the force of force between force acted upon on Q two by Q one.

39:20
So we will use this formula later to look at the total force on a charge in the presence of other charges.

39:26
We will introduce the principle of superposition later and calculate the net force acting on a charge when more than one charge is present surrounding the charge.

39:35
This force which I have written.

39:37
This equation is actually valid in vacuum or free space.

39:50
If you have a medium in between, then the medium complicates the because the medium also consists of charges, electrons and protons, this force law has to be slightly modified.

40:03
And we will come to some discussion on electron statics in the presence of media.

40:09
A little later in the course.

40:11
So that is the force acting between two charges.

40:16
Let me calculate just to give you an idea of the relative magnitude of the electrostatic forces and gravitational forces.

40:28
Gravitation is always attractive.

40:30
Electrostatic forces can be attractive or repulsive.

40:34
So both are different kinds of forces.

40:38
So let us compare and see what is the relative magnitude of these forces.

40:44
So let me take, so let me comp comparison of gravitational and electrostatic forces.

41:11
Stop as an example, we take two alpha particles.

41:15
So this is an alpha particle, here's another alpha particle.

41:26
Now alpha particles are actually nuclei of helium atoms.

41:31
So they have a charge of two E which is equal to 3.2 10 to the minus 19 Kums.

41:44
And the mass of these alpha particles is approximately 6.64 10 to the power minus 27 kg.

41:59
So we take two alpha particles and they have the same charge so they repel each other, they have masses.

42:11
So they attract each other through gravitational force.

42:14
So let's try to compare what is the force of attraction between this that will depend on the mass.

42:21
And what is the force of repulsion between this because of electrostatic forces that will give us an indication of the relative magnitudes of these two forces.

42:33
So the electrostatic force fe is equal to one by 45 epsilon zero Q square by R square where Q is the charge on each alpha particle.

42:56
And R is the separation between the two alpha particles, the gravitational force GM square by R square.

43:15
So it's Tuesday charge of the alpha particle M is the mass of the alpha vertical G is the gravitational constant.

43:39
So we can calculate the ratio of electrostatic to gravitational force which will become one by four by epsilon zero G into Q square by M squared.

43:56
The distance separating the two charges disappears from the equation.

44:01
So this ratio is independent of the separation between the two charges, whether they are close or far apart, the ratio is independent of the separation.

44:11
So now I can substitute the various values into this equation.

44:17
So fe by FG is equal to one by 45 s 70 is approximately 920 per nine Newton meter square by square divided by gravitational.

44:36
This is one by 4570 gravitational constant is 6.67 10 to the minus 11 Newton meter squared by kilogram square and two Q square.

44:53
So 3.2 10 to the power minus 19 kulum square divided by the mass square which is 6.64 10 to the power minus 27 kg square.

45:18
And so if you simplify this, this comes out to be approximately 3.1 and two 10 to about 35 and astonishingly large numbers.

45:41
So you can see that the electrostatic forces are much, much higher than the gravitation forces.

45:54
With microscopic objects, with microscopic objects.

46:00
The charge cancellation between the positive and negative charges is so perfect that if you have two objects like this, although there are huge number of charges in in the, in the both of these objects, the attraction is almost nonexistent.

46:17
There is a gravitational attraction, of course, because the masses are very small, the gravitational attraction you don't feel you need huge masses for gravitational attraction.

46:27
In fact, the very fact that we are able to stand on the earth is because of a gravitational attraction.

46:33
So the charge cancellation between electrons and protons is so perfect that in microscopic objects, unless you charge them like we did in the experiment, the electrostatic forces are negligible.

46:50
Remember that it is these electrostatic forces, electromagnetic forces which are responsible for the atoms and molecules to join together to form solids liquids, etc.

47:07
Now there's another very interesting example, let me try to calculate what is the excess charge required to equal the gravitational attraction between two masses.

47:48
So I'm going to take as an example, 1 kg mass, another 1 kg mass and separated by a distance of 1 m.

48:03
So I want to find out if these objects are neutral, there is no electrostatic attraction or repulsion, there is only a gravitational attraction.

48:14
How much excess charge between these two in these two masses assumed to be equal will create a force which equals this gravitational attraction.

48:23
So no, remember that the static attraction is one by 4570 Q squared by R square.

48:33
The gravitational attraction is G times M squared by R square.

48:40
These are magnitudes if I want these forces to be equal, I must have one by 4570 Q squared by R square is equal to G times M squared VR square.

48:55
And that gives me the following equation, Q is equal to square root of 45 epsilon zero G into mass.

49:09
So because we have taken 1 kg mass, this is 6.67 10 to minus 11 divided by nine into 10.9 this per half into 1 kg.

49:26
And that is about 8.6 into 10 to the power minus 11.

49:36
The exchange excess charge required in each of these masses to counterbalance the gravitational attraction.

49:47
I'm assuming the same charge.

49:48
So there'll be repulsion if I want to counterbalance the gravitational attraction with charging put on the objects, then even an excess charge of about 8.6 10 to the minus 11 colum will result in a force which cancels off this attractive force.

50:08
Now let me assume that these objects are made of copper.

50:18
Its atomic number is 29.

50:27
That means there are 29 electrons per, at 29 protons per atom.

50:35
Now you can go go back and calculate that 1 kg of copper contains about 9.4 into 10 to the power 24 electrons or atoms sorry atoms.

50:55
1 1 kg of copper contains 9.4 to about four atoms.

51:03
Each atom contains 29 electrons.

51:16
So total number of electrons and 1 kg of copper comes out to be 2.7 20 per 26.

51:41
So these are the number of electrons, these are also the number of protons.

51:44
And so the total electron charge if I multiply this by the charge per electron, I will get about 4.3 into 10 power seven kum.

52:06
So please note that the there are so many electrons in 1 kg of copper about 43 million kulum charges and you need only an excess charge of about 9 10 to the minus 11.

52:23
So the percentage of excess charge required is 8.6 10 to the minus 11 divided by 4.3 10 to the power of seven, which is about two inter power minus 60 200 sorry percentage.

52:57
So I have multiple of 100 and that's two in 20 minus 16.

53:03
The percentage of excess charge required is only 10 to the minus 16 to equate the gravitational force by the force.

53:14
So you can see the equality of charge between electrons and protons.

53:22
If one of them had slightly excess charge with equal number of protons and electrons in the material, there would have been some excess charge and that excess charge would have resulted in such a strong attraction or repulsion that they would have completely counterbalanced.

53:38
All gravitational forces.

53:40
So nature has produced such an equality of the charges that matter normally is completely neutral because of the exact cancellation of the electron charge and the criminal charges.

53:55
Yeah, I would like to leave a problem at the end of my talk for you to think about consider two point charges.

54:14
Q one is equal to 0.5 micro column and Q two is equal to one micro colum placed at a separation of 10 centimeters.

54:38
If the charge Q two is increased to four micro colum, there should the charge Q two be placed so that the force on Q one, he's the same as before.

55:30
One micro column is equal to 10 to the minus six.

02_video:
0:40
Good morning to all of you.

0:43
Today, we will continue with our discussion on electrostatics.

0:49
So today we are going to discuss a very, very important law in electrostatics and that is Gauss's law.

1:05
Gauss's law relates electric field and charges.

1:21
And for this, we will need to introduce the concept of flux concept of flux.

1:28
So this flux actually comes from the word it, it means flow in Latin.

1:37
So first we will introduce the concept of flux and I will show you that Gauss's law relates electric flux and charges.

1:54
So to introduce the concept of flux, let me consider fluid flowing with there uniform velocity.

2:18
So I can take, for example, the fluid is flowing like this say, let me assume that this is X, this is Y and this is it.

2:30
So let me assume the fluid is flowing a long day by direction.

2:38
I take a it surface like this C of some linked L and with L and this, this frame is placed perpendicular to the flow direction.

2:58
So the liquid is flowing along the right direction and this frame is parallel to the exact plane.

3:06
So the fluid is crossing this surface and moving from left to right.

3:12
The question I ask myself is what is the volume of fluid crossing the surface per unit time?

3:20
What is the volume?

3:21
So the fluid is flowing through the surface?

3:23
So how much volume of fluid is flowing per unit time through the surface?

3:28
Now, if I look at the fluid flowing through the surface, so here is my surface fluid is flowing like this through the surface.

3:42
Now you see if the surface area is s and the velocity is V as I wrote, then how much fluid will cross, how much volume of fluid will cross?

4:00
To understand that let me take a link equal to B from here.

4:05
So this length is B.

4:08
So there is an imaginary plane I consider a distance V from the surface.

4:12
This is my actual surface through which I'm trying to find out the rate of fluid flow.

4:18
And I consider an imaginary surface at distance V from this surface.

4:23
Now, as the fluid flows remember the flow, the fluid is flowing with velocity V.

4:28
So this surface after a unit time would have come and into the surface.

4:33
So this surface I attached with the surface I move with the fluid.

4:37
And in a unit time, this surface, the back surface would have come and coincided with the front surface.

4:45
So what it implies is all the fluid contained within this volume would have crossed the surface in a unit time.

4:54
So volume rate of flow will be the volume contained in this, in this the volume of fluid contained in this in this volume.

5:08
And what is the volume of this the surface area into this length?

5:13
So that means B into S so this is go flux flux of fluid flow through this area is velocity times the surface area.

5:28
And in this case, I'm considering the area to be perpendicular to the direction of flow.

5:34
So this implies that V times s volume of fluid is flowing crossing this area per unit time.

5:44
Now that's an area perpendicular to the flow direction.

5:47
But suppose my area was not perpendicular through direction, suppose the liquid was flowing like this.

5:52
And my a my my frame happened to be at an angle.

6:01
So this is an angle theta.

6:04
So this is my frame.

6:04
Now I've inclined to play the frame, the same area I've inclined.

6:09
And now you see that the rate of flow will change because imagine the limit when this frame becomes parallel to the direction of fluid flow, no fluid will be crossing the area because they're all flowing parallel to the area.

6:26
So now how do I calculate this?

6:30
So let me look from this side.

6:31
So I have this line.

6:33
This is my vertical.

6:34
This is the, so I can take a point which is at a distance V from here.

6:43
This is my AD Rs so all the fluid within this volume.

6:47
So this this is also b all the fluid contained in this volume would have flown through the surface in a unit time, just like in the earlier case, the fluid which was lying at a distance V from the surface would have crossed the surface in a unit time.

7:03
Here.

7:03
Also all the fluid contained within this volume would have crossed the surface.

7:09
And the volume of this fluid now is nothing but V times S cost.

7:20
This is, and this is V that's a parallelogram and its volume, its area is vs costa multiplied by the other dimension.

7:29
If you, if you multiply by the other dimension, this dimension, then you'll get the volume which is BS of theta.

7:36
So the this is now the flux is V SS costa, the flux is reduced because the this area is now projected with a smaller area as far as the fluid flow is concerned.

7:55
So this area, this area is inclined to the fluid flow.

7:58
So although the area is s the fluid is actually only crossing through this area which with its projection.

8:07
So if you see if the becomes 90 degrees because the becomes zero and the flux becomes zero.

8:13
So if the, if the fluid is flowing like this and your frame happens to be like this, obviously, there is no fluid crossing the surface, it is just grazing the surface and going away.

8:25
So the flux depends on the angle between the surface and the direction of fluid flow and the flux happens to be vs the.

8:34
Now what is the cost?

8:36
The B is this direction and theta is this angle.

8:42
So if I draw a normal to the surface, this vector is perpendicular surface, this line is perpendicular this line.

8:50
So this angle is also theta.

8:52
So this is nothing but B dot N into S because V dot N is because the N is the unit normal to the S and so B dot Ns is the flux now, so this tells me that the flux now flux of fluid flow depends on the angle made by the surface with the direction of the fluid flow.

9:25
Now, I can write this in a more compact form by introducing what is called as a vector area.

9:36
So if I have an idea, if I define an area like this support, the area is S and this is the direction of the normal to this area, I define the vector area.

9:49
S vector is equal to S times.

9:51
And capital vector area is a vector whose magnitude is equal to the area of the surface and whose direction is the normal to the surface.

10:06
Of course, for a surface like this, whether I choose this normal or that normal, there is an ambiguity.

10:12
But later on, we will be discussing close surfaces in which this ambiguity is resolved.

10:18
So a vector area contains not only the magnet area but also the unit vector perpendicular to that area.

10:27
So the vector area, not only gives me the area but also its orientation.

10:32
For example, if I take an area, suppose I have the three axes like this XYZ, if I take an area here in the exit plane, it's normal, we'll be pointing like this.

10:50
So if the area is this vector area will be S times Jacob if you take another area, the same area and put it in another direction, say for example, I put it like this, this AD RS this is IC.

11:15
So vector area here is KC.

11:31
So the magnitude of these areas are equal but the directions are different and that is contained in the unit normal.

11:37
So vector area is a very useful concept that you will be using in many different subjects.

11:42
But this vector area contains not only the magnitude area but also the direction of that is the direction of the normal area.

11:52
So what we now would like to do is I would like to calculate what is the flux.

12:00
So although I have introduced the flux as the flow of a fluid, this flux concept can be generalized to all vector fields.

12:12
So I can define an electric flux with respect to the electric field vector, we know the electric field is the vector.

12:23
And so if you have for example, a surface like this of ad is factor is like this.

12:32
And if the electric field disappointing in this direction, so it's uniform electric field, I will define the electric flux five se times S actually it is E dot S but S is the vector area and it is the electric vector.

13:08
And so E dot S is nothing but because in this case E and S are parallel E dot S is E times S so that's the electric flux.

13:17
In the case of fluid flow, there was actually a fluid which is flowing through the surface.

13:23
But in the case of an electric field, there is nothing which is flowing.

13:28
I have extended the concept of flux to a vector field like electric field.

13:32
So I can, this will give me what is the something like the number of electric field lines crossing the surface area?

13:40
But this is there's nothing flowing in the electric field case, it is simply represents a quantity.

13:47
So now let me try to calculate, I'm more interested in a calculation in which I want to see what is the flux crossing a closed area.

13:57
So I'm I'm taking a closed surface which is closed.

14:01
So as an example, let me take a cube of side L killed of side L.

14:16
So this tube has and this cube is oriented along the xyz axis like this, which I've shown.

14:22
And let me assume that I have a constant uniform military field e vector along the by direction.

14:40
So monitoring vector is pointing like this on the right direction.

14:45
It's it's supposed to be uniform.

14:47
So I want to calculate what is the net flux of electric field passing through this closed surface.

14:54
This is the close surface as you can see here.

14:56
It's a cube which I'm taking as an example.

14:59
And the cube encloses a volume and the cube is a completely closed surface.

15:05
Now, although the normal to the surface was ambiguous.

15:09
In the earlier case here, we always define the normal to be the output normal.

15:16
So outward means a normal direction which is pointing out of the volume.

15:21
So for example, on the surface, the output normal is in this direction on the surface, the outward normal is up on the bottom surface, the outward normal is downward on the side normal, the normal is here and on the surface, the normal is in the other direction and behind the normal is like this.

15:41
So there are six surfaces and six normals and all the normals are taken to be outward normals.

15:52
So I want to calculate what is the net flux of electric field through this volume through the all the surfaces.

15:59
So what I will do is I will calculate the net flux through the surface to the surface through this side surface here and to the back surface, the top surface and the bottom surface.

16:13
So there are six surfaces, we will individually calculate the flux cross flux of electric wheel crossing each and every individual surface add them up and get the total flux.

16:23
So let me start calculating the flux.

16:30
And let me show you some slide.

16:40
So in the slide, as you can see here, the this is the cube, this is the electric field which is pointing along the right direction.

16:50
So the electric field is eno J cap, these are the electric field lines and this is the cube, the same cube shown with all the surface normals.

16:59
So the the normal to the surface which I've called BC XG is along the X direction ICA direction.

17:08
The one which is behind which is ad if is minus si cap because it is in the minus X direction, the top surface ghif has the normal along the KC direction.

17:22
The bottom surface B CD A is minus K cap direction.

17:27
And similarly, this surface H CD I has plus SJC direction and this back surface GB A F has minus SJK direction.

17:39
So these are all the six surface normals.

17:42
So I need to calculate what is the flux crossing each of one of the surfaces.

17:47
So let me calculate on this sheet of paper here.

17:50
So let me consider the surface.

17:52
So let me draw the figure here.

17:55
So I have this cube XYZ and so electric vector is eno JC.

18:09
So plus let me calculate what is the flux through the surface.

18:11
So this surface has a unit vector which is JC.

18:15
So this of end of area S so, so let me call this flux 51.

18:24
Let me use the same indices.

18:26
This is called B CD K and this is G H inf so this is a flux F one is two surface edge CD I.

18:44
So this will be E dot S which is not JC dot SJ cap which is nothing but E not times S the surface is SJ cap electric vector is eno J cap.

19:06
So the flux to the surface is E dot S So eno JCA dot SJ cap which is eno times s now what is the flux through the back surface that is this back surface.

19:21
So this is a F GB this is equal to again E dot E dot S which is equal to E not J cap.

19:33
Now remember the back surface has a unit vector which is S times minus J cap.

19:41
So this is equal to minus he not s so you can understand that the flux is negative because the surface area is pointing towards minus JK direction.

19:55
The electric factory is pointing towards plus JK direction and the dot product of these two is minus E not SS we can similarly calculate the flux through the remaining surfaces.

20:06
So let me take one more example.

20:08
So flux through, let me calculate the flux through the surface which is BC HG.

20:28
So this is equal to, let me call it 53 which is equal to E dot S which is equal to EOT JC dot Now S factor S factor is what let me see here.

20:42
So this is S and this S vector is actually S times I cap because this normal is pointing towards ICAP direction dot SI cap which is equal to zero because G cap dot I cap is zero G and I are perpend to each other.

21:02
So that is zero.

21:04
And you can again understand this because as I mentioned before, the electric vector is pointing along the right direction and the surface is actually the right direction is parallel surface.

21:16
So there are no electric flux lines crossing the surface.

21:19
So similarly, you can show that the flux crossing the back surface, the bottom surface and the top surface are all or are equal to zero.

21:28
And so the total flux is nothing but the sum of these two and that happens to become equal to zero.

21:34
So total flux for this example, total electric flux sequel to E not S minus E not s it's 0 to 0.

21:53
So there is no flux electric flux crossing through this is zero.

21:58
Please note electric field is not zero.

22:00
Electric field is finite, it is uniform but it so happens that the amount of electric field lines entering one surface is equal to the electric field lines leaving the surface.

22:09
So this particular flux is from the front surface here, this flux is from the back surface and they assume they are equal to each other and opposite of each other of opposites.

22:18
And so the total becomes zero and there is no flux entering the remaining four surfaces.

22:24
And so the net flux becomes zero.

22:26
So I can actually calculate using this flux formula.

22:31
What is the flux of a vector field through any closed surface?

22:35
Now let me show you another slide.

22:37
So this in this case, I had a cube which was exactly oriented with the axis.

22:41
Now let me take a situation where the cube, let me look, look showed you the slide in which the cube is now not placed along the axis but inclined.

22:53
So I rotated in the cube around the z axis so that the line A B makes an angle of theta with respect to X axis.

23:03
So now I need to again, I want to again calculate the total electric flux.

23:08
So for which I need to draw all these surface normals.

23:11
So here is the slide which shows you.

23:14
So the the front surface which is shown as red here has an electric flux pointing, the surface area is pointing in this direction theta is the angle between the x axis and this plane.

23:26
So we can write the surface area area vector for this surface.

23:32
Similarly the area vector for this surface which is exactly opposite of this vector because it is in the opposite direction, the area vector for this surface, the area vector for the back surface, the area vector for the top surface and the area vector for the bottom surface So this, for example, this vector you can, you can see but this line is parallel to this line here.

23:53
And so this makes an angle theta with the X axis.

23:56
So this unit vector has a component cause theta along X direction and sine theta along the bidi direction.

24:02
And that is why the area vector is given by this, the magnitude of this vector is same as S and the direction is given by IC cost plus JC.

24:14
So I can actually find out the unit vectors of all surfaces.

24:20
And then from these unit vectors, I can calculate the total flux.

24:24
So for example, let me calculate the flux through different red surface which is shown in the slide.

24:33
So the electric flux.

24:40
So electric plus now I've gone back to the surface VC HG that is this this surface here front surface.

24:51
And let me show you the slide in the in the slide here.

24:54
So this is, let me call this 51 which is equal to E dot S which is equal to E not JC dot SN two I cap of theta plus JK which happens to equal to E not S because JK dot I cap is zero, this flu becomes not SS the flux through the back surface.

25:30
Which if you see the slide here, this back surface or the flux flux through ad if which is exactly the surface opposite to the surface in the in the slide, you can see the area vector.

25:54
So Phi is equal to E dot S which is equal to E not JC dot S in two minus I cap cost, the minus JK which is equal to minus S into eno.

26:23
So you got the flux through the back surface.

26:28
Similarly, you can calculate the flux through the remaining surfaces.

26:33
The flux through the top surface will be zero, the flux through the bottom surface will be zero.

26:37
And the other two fluxes, let me write down the expression here.

26:40
The other two fluxes will be if I call this by three, it's equal to So if you look at this the surface, the the surface which is shown blue in the slide here, if you can see the slide, it is shown as the blue surface here and that is through the through that is E dot S which is E knot JC dot S minus IC plus JK cost which is equal to E not S and finally, the flux two, the surface which is opposite to the surface is EOT E dot S which is equal to eno JC dot SN two I minus JK cost which is equal to minus E not S cost and flux through top and bottom surfaces equal to zero because the the normal, the surface normals or the surface areas are perpendicular to the directional vector.

28:10
So if you got four fluxes too, so you have flux through the four surfaces.

28:15
One is eno theta, the other is minus E not theta, one of them is not the, the other one is minus E not the.

28:23
And you can now see the total flux will be the sum of all these four fluxes.

28:28
And that happens to be again zero.

28:35
So not minus E, not sin theta plus E, not S cost theta minus E not S cost theta which is equal to zero.

28:55
So the flux crossing each surface has changed but the net flux is still zero.

29:00
So this is the technique to calculate the flux through any close surface.

29:05
I draw, I look at the normal close surface and then calculate E dot the area vector for each of these areas and I will get the total flux.

29:17
So no, we'll come to.

29:24
So once having defined electric flux electric field flux, now let us look at Gauss's law.

29:32
So as an example to, to calculate electric flux, let me consider the charge Q and let me take a sphere around the charge sphere of radius R.

29:44
So this is a sphere of.

29:54
So my problem is to calculate, what is the electric flux crossing the surface?

30:01
What is the electric flux crossing this sphere because of the point charges placed at the center of the sphere.

30:08
Now what is the electric field generated by the point charge?

30:10
We know this one by four pipes is zero Q by R square into R cap there a cap is the direction and what is the distance from the center?

30:26
So this is the electric field at any point at a distance small R from the charge.

30:31
And R cap is a unit vector from the charge pointing out like this along the radial direction.

30:38
Now I'm assuming a positive charge here.

30:40
So the unit vector, the R vector R cap is along this direction.

30:46
Now to calculate the total flux through the sphere, I must know the area vector.

30:51
So for example, at this place, the area vector will be pointing like this, I just play the area vector will be like this.

30:57
I just play the area vector will be like this.

30:59
They will all be radially pointing away from the center, it's a sphere.

31:06
So the area vector of any patch of the sphere will be pointing away from the center.

31:12
And so this will be the area, this will be the direction of the area vector.

31:16
So what you can see is unlike the example before the area vector, the area direction of the area vector keeps on changing as you move along the surface.

31:25
But at all points, the area vector he's along the line joining the center to the center of that area.

31:32
But now as you can see here, the electric field is radial along the line joining the charge to this to the point on the sphere.

31:44
And at that point.

31:45
So suppose I want to calculate the flux to a small area here.

31:50
This is there a trivial direction and the area is also in the same direction.

31:58
So what I need to do is because of a surface which is not flat.

32:02
What I must do is I must take a small area here, a small area DS vector.

32:09
Then I calculate, I know the electric field at that point.

32:12
So I calculate the small flux through that which is E dot Ds.

32:18
So Ds is a small area, Ds vector is a small area vector, E is electric field at that point.

32:25
I calculate E dot Ds there that gives me the flux through this small area.

32:29
So I calculate like this, I divide the entire sphere into areas at around all around the place and add up all the fluxes to get the total flux.

32:39
Now, as I mentioned at every point, the area vector points along the direction of the electric vector because the electric vector is radial and so is the area vector because the, the charge is located at the center of the sphere.

32:53
So E and S become equal in the same direction.

32:59
The other thing I noticed is that electric field across all the points on the sphere is the same because the charge is centered at the in the at the center of the sphere, the electric vector electric field at all points on the sphere is exactly the same.

33:15
And electric field on the sphere will be the magnitude will be one by four by epsilon zero, Q by R square.

33:24
So electric field is the same at all points on the sphere.

33:28
The electric vector is parallel to the area vector at all points of the sphere.

33:31
So the total flux total flux will be electric field into the area of the sphere.

33:41
Because the electric field is the same at all points on the sphere.

33:43
So the total flux will be electric field into four pi R square which happens to be Q by ep zero.

33:55
So if you have a point charge placed at the center of a sphere, the net electric flux flowing through the sphere is Q by epsilon zero.

34:10
That's a statement of Gauss Law.

34:12
If you have a point charge at the center of a sphere, then the total flux electric flux crossing the sphere is Q by epsilon zero.

34:21
No.

34:23
What will happen if the surface which I'm considering, I'm let me take the same point charge but a surface which is not a sphere.

34:33
So the problem would be what will happen to the flux.

34:36
So I want to calculate the flux through a surface which is not a sphere.

34:41
So I have the point charge here.

34:43
This was the sphere which I draw drew earlier and I have some, some arbitrary surface.

34:47
So let me show you a slide here in a slide I have I'm showing you a charge placed at the center of a sphere in the slide, you can see the center of the sphere having a charge.

35:04
So this is the sphere here which I'm drawing as S one.

35:08
And there is some arbitrary surface here which I'm calling S two.

35:11
And these lines represent the electric field lines from this point charge.

35:15
They're all radial pointing away from the point charge.

35:18
So I take a small area here and I draw the electric field lines crossing that area.

35:28
Now, as you can see here, these lines, the three lines come out and hit the other area, the S two surface over some other manager of area and orientation.

35:40
Please remember this arbitrary surface is has its normal at every point in different directions.

35:46
So here I've drawn a small patch having its a vector shown as the arrow here.

35:53
The a vector on the surface of the sphere is along this direction because this is the center of the sphere and field is also parallel to it here, the field is pointing like this and the area of vector is pointing in some other direction.

36:06
So I need to calculate for the flux through this.

36:10
I had simply multiplied the electric field by the area.

36:13
Here, I need to remember that this is makes an angle.

36:17
So I will have to calculate the dot product of this electric vector and this area vector.

36:23
Now, as you can see here, if I imagine electric field lines coming from the point charge, all those lines which are crossing the small area here will also be crossing the same area here.

36:34
Although this area is larger, it's oriented in a different direction.

36:39
And so its projection will be along a direction perpendicular to this electric field line.

36:45
And as we discussed before, I will have a component DS cost theta.

36:50
And if I can imagine electric field lines starting from the point charge and moving out the number of electric field lines crossing this area on the sphere will be equal to the number of electric field lines crossing this area on the arbitrary surface.

37:04
So I can extend this argument.

37:06
And for every patch of area on the arbitrary surface, I can make a projection back to the point charge.

37:13
And that projection will intersect the sphere in a small area.

37:17
And so what I will see is for every area on the arbitrary surface I have a small area on the sphere and they will have the same flux of electric field passing by.

37:28
So what this argument implies is that the net flux crossing the sphere is exactly equal to the net flux cross crossing this arbitrary surface area.

37:39
You can also imagine this by understanding that these are electric field lines, all the lines which are emanating from this point charge which are crossing this surface, spherical surface will also be crossing this other surface area.

37:50
And so the net flux of electric field through the arbitrary surface is the same as the flux through the sphere and the flux through the sphere, we have just calculated as Q by Epson and zero.

38:02
So if I come back to the to the slide here, as we see the point charge has the flux Q by epsilon zero, whether you take the sphere or an arbitrary surface surrounding the point charge.

38:24
So this is the general like Gauss's Law.

38:27
So Gauss's Law states that the flux through this through an arbitrary surface which encloses this point charge Q is Q by epsilon zero.

38:42
So this implies essentially that weather, the point charge is at the center of the sphere or anywhere if you put the P charge here, even then the flux it will be two by epsilon zero.

38:57
This is irrespective of where you put the net flux will be zero, sorry two by 70 and independent of position of this charge because this, this will appear like an arbitrary surface surrounding this point charge.

39:13
Now what will happen if I have more charges?

39:16
So have a charge Q one, another charge Q two, the total flux will be equal to Q one by and zero because of charge Q one plus Q two by five and zero.

39:35
Because of charge Q two, you have another charge Q three plus Q three by five and zero because of charge three, et cetera.

39:44
So this will be nothing but sigma Q I by epsilon zero, which is equal to two by and zero there Q is the total charge and closed and close by the surface.

40:09
Let me write it again here.

40:11
So if I had, if I had a number of charges, Q one Q two Q three, et cetera, so if I consider any surface A S so total electric flux is equal to the sum of the charges, all the charges inside by family which is sigma and the sigma Q I, he's charges and toast.

40:59
And that is Gauss's law.

41:00
So Gauss's law states that if you have any surface which surrounds a set of charges, the total electric flux crossing, that surface is equal to the sum of all the charges present within this, within the enclosed by the surface divided by epsilon zero.

41:20
This is a very, very important law and this law is used to solve problems in electrostatics especially when you have certain kind of symmetries in the problem.

41:33
As I will show you through examples, it is very easy to use Gauss's law to calculate electric fields.

41:40
Or if I have, if I know the electric field in certain situations, I will be able to calculate what is the charge of distribution.

41:49
So what this Gauss's law states, it tells me is the relationship between the electric flux crossing a surface and the charges enclosed by the surface.

41:59
Now, I must mention a couple of points here in this Gauss's law.

42:04
These are the charges enclosed by the surface.

42:08
So suppose I have a surface suppose I have Q 11 charge here, another charge Q two, another charge Q three, the total flux is equal to Q one plus Q two by and zero.

42:29
Because Q three is not enclosed by the surface Q three is not enclosed by the surface.

42:35
So as you can see here, the electric field lines will go like this.

42:39
And as we saw in the case of cube, what will happen is there are field lines entering the surface and there are also field lines, same field lines will leave the surface.

42:50
So the net flux because of the charge lying outside the volume enclosed by the surface will not contribute to the total flux.

42:58
So in this flux equation five is equal to charge and closed by epsilon zero.

43:12
So in this flux equation, we are only adding up the charges which are enclosed within the surface or by the surface and any charge lying outside the surface does not contribute to the flux.

43:24
At the same time, please remember that the electric field at any point is the sum of the electric field produced by all charges whether inside or outside.

43:35
So the electric field here will consist of electric field because of Q one plus electric field because of Q two plus electric field because of Q three, the flux which is crossing, this will only depend on Q one and Q two.

43:47
Because Q three, the flux from Q three actually the the the amount of flux entering the surface because the Q three will be equal to the electric flux leaving the same surface.

43:59
So Q three does not contribute to the flux.

44:01
While Q one and Q two which are enclosed within the surface are actually contributing to the flux.

44:08
So we must remember that electric fields at every point is determined by all charges present in the system.

44:16
While the flux through any closed surface is determined only by the charges enclosed by that surface.

44:25
So this particular law is valid for any arbitrary surface and is useful in a situation where there is symmetric as we will discuss later as an example, wherever there is symmetry in my system, I can use this this law to find out the electric field because of a charge distribution.

44:52
In some situations I can use in the reverse case when I have an electric field, I know the electric field, I can use that to calculate the charge distribution.

45:04
Also remember that this law is based on the inverse square law of of Kums in law like an example of a charge at the center of a sphere which I cal which I calculated the flux in this.

45:22
Remember we had done the director field was varying as one by R square, the area was increasing as art square.

45:31
So the flux is independent of the radius of the sphere.

45:37
So whether you take a small sphere or a big sphere, the electric flux remains the same.

45:44
Now, this is based on the fact that electric field goes as one by R square.

45:49
The inverse square law, if the electric field has was not following the inverse square law, then the flux would have depended on the radius.

45:57
And the things would have been very different.

46:01
Also remember that because the flux law depends on inverse square law all vector fields which follow the inverse square law will satisfy a Gauss's law.

46:13
So gravitational field which also decreases as one by R square, we also have a law which is similar to Gauss's law, we also satisfies laws similar to Gauss's law.

46:26
Now let's calculate, let's use some of this discussion to look at some examples.

46:35
The first example I want to see is conductors.

46:46
So we saw earlier that a conductor is a is a medium in which there are three electrons which can flow.

46:55
And because of this in a static situation, there can be no electric field within the conductor because if an electric field existed within the conductor that will push the electrons that will force their attempts to move and I will not be in a static situation.

47:10
So once I have reached the equilibrium, there can be no electric field, no electrostatic field within a conductor.

47:19
Now suppose I consider the following problem, I take a conductor, a solid conductor and put some extra charges into the conductor.

47:29
So these are called excess charges, these are charges beyond the electrons and protons that present in the conductor that are present in the conductor.

47:36
So I put some extra charges.

47:38
Now the question arises, where are these charges sitting?

47:41
Are they inside the volume of the conductor or are they on the surface of the conductor or are they in both places?

47:48
So we will use Gauss's law to solve this problem.

47:51
So now I have a conductor in which I have thrown some excess charge.

47:55
So I throw a charge, Q some excess charge Q into the conductor.

48:00
So the question is where are they sitting?

48:04
Now from my earlier argument in an electrostatic situation, E must be zero inside, inside the volume of the conductor, there's no electric field inside the conductor.

48:14
So what I do is I take a surface inside the conductor, I I take a sphere inside the conductor, the entire sphere is inside the conductor.

48:24
Now this is called the Gaussian surface to employ Gauss's Law.

48:36
I consider it a surface an imaginary surface of any arbitrary shape which is, which suits me, which is called a Gaussian surface.

48:46
So in this case, I take a sphere, for example, the sphere encloses the entire conductor and I want to apply the law.

48:57
So first thing is the electric field at all points on this must be zero because there is no electric field within the conductor.

49:04
So the net flux must be zero because net flux is equal to charge and closed 570.

49:18
And because the electric field at every point on the surface is zero, the net flux crossing the surface is zero.

49:27
And that means the net charge enclosed by the surface is zero.

49:32
Now please remember when we calculate the net flux, we have to be aware that the charges can be negative or positive.

49:40
So for example, if I have, if I take a pulse charge at the center of a sphere, the flux will be cube of sal and zero if the charge is negative.

49:53
So here the electric field lines are going like this here.

49:58
If it is a negative charge, the electric field lines are moving inside.

50:04
So the flux will be minus Q by 70.

50:11
If I take a situation where I have A plus Q and A minus Q, for example, a dipole and this is my surface, the net flux will be zero because plus two by epsilon zero because of this.

50:26
So we have seen the electric field lines like this as many electric field lines will come out as we will get back in.

50:37
So the net flux because of the presence of these two charges becomes zero.

50:41
And that is because the total charge enclosed by the surface becomes zero.

50:46
So in flux calculation, I must keep track of the sign of the charges.

50:51
So let me come back to the conductor here.

50:55
I'm taking a Gaussian surface and I find that electric field at every point on the surface is zero.

51:03
So the net flux must be zero, which implied that the charge and close is zero.

51:11
No, I reduce the radius of the sphere to smaller and smaller values.

51:17
The electric flu continues to be zero until I reach almost a point which means that the charge enclosed by that sphere becomes is always zero, no matter what the size of the sphere is, which means that there can be no excess charge within the conductor.

51:33
So I can take the sphere at different points on my conductor wherever I want.

51:37
And I find that the net flux enclosed by the sphere is zero by the sphere is zero by the sphere is zero by this sphere is zero.

51:44
So and because the net flux is zero and that is because the electric field is zero and I can reduce the size of each sphere to smaller and smaller values until I reach a point, there can be no charge inside the volume of the conductor, no excess charge.

51:59
So all it implies is whenever you put an excess charge on a conductor, all the excess charge remains on the surface surface.

52:15
So by excess charge, as I said, the charge which we add to the conductor, these do not include the electrons and protons which are part of the material of the conductor.

52:23
So here is an example where I've used Gauss's law to find out whether there are charges within the excess charges within the conductor, which means knowing the electric field to be zero.

52:36
I have argued using Gauss's law that there can be no excess charge within the volume of the conductor, all the excess charge that you put will be sitting on the surface.

52:46
So that's an interesting result that I get by using Gauss's law.

52:50
So here is an, this was an example where I used Gauss's law to calculate the charge distribution from a non electric field distribution.

53:00
So electric field was zero inside.

53:01
So that gives me no charge inside.

53:05
Now let me calculate, let me take another example.

53:08
So let me take a sphere conducting sphere with charge plus you.

53:24
So here is the sphere, the solid sphere and I put charge Q on this.

53:32
Now from my earlier argument, all this charge must be sitting on the surface of this conductor, there will be no charge inside the conductor.

53:43
All this charge is sitting on the surface of the conductor.

53:47
No symmetry plays a very important role in many of these problems.

53:55
So the question is when I put the plus Q charge excess charge on the conductor, where is it on the surface?

54:02
The first thing is from Gauss's Law, I have shown that the charge must be residing on the surface, it cannot be within the, within the volume of the conductor.

54:09
So where is it sitting?

54:11
Now if you see a sphere is completely symmetric, there is no preferential point anywhere on the sphere which means that the charge must be equally distributed everywhere across the sphere.

54:25
On the surface of the sphere, there cannot be any point on the sphere which has a little more charge because all points on the sphere are equivalent to each other.

54:34
So when I put a charge plus Q on the sphere that will be distributed uniformly right across the surface of the conductor.

54:42
And so this charge will generate a surface charge density.

54:53
Remember I had called it sigma before or is the radius of the sphere.

55:01
So the charges are all sitting on the surface of the sphere as a surface charge density Q by four pr square.

55:12
Now I want to calculate what is the electric field produced by this conducting conductor with an excess charge plus Q which is uniformly distributed on the surface.

55:23
What is the electric field that this conductor will now produce as far as outside region is concerned?

55:31
So I will now use the gas law.

55:35
First thing I could have in principle, I have to solve the problem by taking every charge on the surface of the conductor.

55:42
Calculate the electric field at a point.

55:44
Suppose I want to calculate the electric field here, I must take the charge here.

55:47
Find a electric field from here.

55:48
What the electric field from here, what the electric field of this point from here and so on all the electric fields I must add at this point to calculate the total electric field.

55:57
That problem becomes a little more involved.

55:59
We can use Gauss's law to calculate the electric field of this charge conductor.

56:05
So this I will discuss in the next class where I will calculate, what is the electric bill produced by this conductor which is a spherical conductor in which I've thrown an excess charge capital Q.

56:19
And we will use Gauss's Law.

56:21
And we will see how the calculation becomes very simple.

56:26
I'd like to end the discussion here with one problem for you to think about.

56:38
So let me consider A plus Q here, the minus Q here.

56:45
A minus two Q here and A plus two Q here.

56:50
So I draw two surfaces.

56:54
This I called S one and this I called S two.

56:59
So first is calculate the electric flux two S one and S two store drive a closed surface through which flux is a maximum and B and negative and another one is positive and Mexico.

58:02
So I want you to draw surfaces Gaussian surfaces to which the flux is positive and maximum.

58:09
A surface in which the flux is negative and maximum.

58:13
Thank you very much.

video_03:
0:41
A very good morning to all of you.

0:44
So we continue with our lectures on electrostatics.

0:51
Until now, I have introduced the concept of charge, the properties of charges.

0:59
Then we discussed the Kums Law which describes the force between two charges two point charges.

1:08
And then we also discussed about principle of superposition where if you have a charge, if you have a couple of charges.

1:18
For example, if you have one charge, Q one another charge, Q two, another third charge Q three, the force between charge Q one and Q two is independent of the presence of the charge Q three.

1:32
So Q two, the effect, the charge Q one the force on the charge Q one because of Q two is the same as given by Kums Law in the absence of Q three.

1:45
Similarly, the charge QQ three has a force on Q one, irrespective of the presence of Q two.

1:51
So we can actually write the total force on Q, the charge Q one as the sum of the forces due to Q two and they force due to guilty.

2:04
And remember force is a vector.

2:07
So if for example, if this was a positive and this is positive and this is negative, then this force will be in this direction, this force will be in this direction.

2:16
So I have to add vector the forces between Q two and Q one and Q three and Q one and to get the total force on Q one.

2:25
So we have introduced all this today, I'm going to introduce a very important concept in the Retros statics.

2:31
That is the concept of electric field.

2:46
Now, we saw in the experiments that the two straws which were robbed had charges.

2:56
So they if I bring one charge, one straw close to redraw, it repels that that straw.

3:02
I also showed that if you have a straw which is charged and if you have a glass rod which was charged, if you bring the glass rod near it attracts the straw and they stick to each other.

3:12
So the question is, how does this force get transmitted?

3:16
How is this charge able to attract or ripple another charge?

3:20
Although there is no direct link between them, there is no string connecting them, there is no object connecting these two.

3:26
So one way to visualize this is to assume that there is action at a distance.

3:32
That means I can assume that this charge can act on this charge.

3:37
Although there is no apparent connection between these two.

3:40
Similarly, this charge can affect this charge, either a tractor or repellent.

3:46
There's another very nice way of describing this effect.

3:50
And that is through the concept of electric field, electric field.

3:58
So what we say is that if you have a charge, say plus Q charge here, then this charge sets up in the surrounding space, a field called the electric field.

4:12
And if you put another charge here, which is a minus Q dash, then this charge minus Q dash senses this electric field and gets attracted to this charge.

4:22
Cube plus cube.

4:24
So plus Q charge sets up an electric field in the space surrounding the charge, which then affects the charge minus two prime by either attracting or repelling it.

4:36
Similarly, the charge minus Q prime sets up its electric field which then affects P plus Q charge by attracting or repelling it depending on the signs of the charges.

4:46
So what we say is that every charge creates in its surrounding an electric field and it is that electric field which then affects other charges present in the system.

5:01
So electric field is an intermediary between charge as an intermediary to affect forces between two charges.

5:10
Please remember that the charge plus Q set ups electric field but that electric field cannot have any force on the charge itself.

5:19
So the electric field produced by plus Q charge affects all other charges in the vicinity.

5:25
Similarly, the electric field produces by produced by minus Q prime affects all other charges present in the vicinity but not the charge itself.

5:32
So this you must remember, so we will define, we will say that a charge, if you have a charge plus Q here, then the electric field set up by this charge is given by one by four by epsilon zero Q by R square into a capital.

5:55
There R is the distance this one and this is our capital.

6:02
So actually, this is valid for all charges.

6:04
So let me not just charge plus Q, it is some charge Q could be positive or negative.

6:09
So we say that any charge QE sets up an electric field in its surrounding and the electric field at any point here at the point P which is at a distance small R from this charge.

6:23
Capital Q is given by one by four by epsilon zero capital Q by R square into R cap where R cap is the unit vector joining this charge Q to the point P.

6:36
So if this electric field is set up, we then say that if you put a charge small Q here, the force acting on the charge is Q times electric field which is equal to one by four by epsilon zero Q times Q by R square into a cap which is nothing but Kums Law.

6:56
So what you say is every charge sets up an electric field and that electric field then exerts a force on any other charge present in this in the space.

7:06
And the force is given by the product of the charge and the electric field.

7:14
So this electric field is produced by these chargers and it is the electric field which is the intermediary, which is responsible for attraction and repulsion of these charges.

7:30
From this discussion, it also follows that I can define the electric field as force divided by charge or force exerted per unit charge.

7:42
So if you have a charge capital Q here I can put a unit charge at this point and see the force that is felt by this charge and that force will be called the electric field.

7:53
Now, I must be a little careful in this definition because there may be a number of charges in, in a, in a region.

8:01
Suppose I have a number of charges say Q one Q two, et cetera QNN charges.

8:10
So I want to find a directory field here at this point.

8:13
So if I put a small charge here, I can find out the force on this, on this charge Q and divide that force by this small charge Q to get the electric field at that point.

8:26
Now, I must make sure in this definition that this charge queue when you bring it here and put it here does not affect the position of all the remaining charges.

8:36
So these charges should not get displaced or moved because of the presence of this charge.

8:41
So they have to be held at the same place.

8:43
So that what I measure here, the force is exactly because of the electric field at that point, because of all these charges.

8:50
So in this definition, I can also define the electric field at this point is the force felt by a charge in the limit of the charge going to zero.

9:03
So this definition, I must be I, I can use it.

9:06
So I can actually, if you have, for example, if you have a positive charge, if you have a positive charge here, then the electric field at this point as as you can see the electric field, we have defined as Q by four by epsilon zero R squared into a cap.

9:26
So if capital Q is positive, then the electric field is in the same direction as a cap.

9:31
So positive charge will produce an electric field in this direction.

9:33
Here in this point, it will produce an electric field along this direction at this point.

9:38
It will produce an electric field along this direction at this point, it will produce an electric field along this direction.

9:44
Similarly, if you have a negative charge, then the electric field direction because capital Q is negative, the electric field direction will be along minus our cap.

9:54
So the electric field at this point will be along this direction, electric field at this point will be along this direction.

10:00
Electric electric field at this point will be along this direction.

10:03
Similarly along at this point, we will be along this direction.

10:05
So electric field, these electric fields are directed towards positive charges and sorry away from positive charges and towards negative charges.

10:17
Now I can, this is the electric field for one point.

10:21
Similarly, I can write the total electric field in the presence of a number of charges as Sigma, I is equal to one to N one by four by epsilon zero Q I by RP I square into RP I.

10:42
So I have a number of judges, Q one Q two Q three and so on.

10:49
And Qn.

10:50
So I'm trying to find out the electric field at this point point P so I I have this fact these lines here joining these, these are lines here.

10:59
So this is R one P R sorry RP one, this is RB two et cetera.

11:09
And similarly finally, this one is RP and vector.

11:14
These are all the cursor.

11:18
So the total electric field at this point is the sum of the electric field produced by this charge, this charge discharge and so on.

11:24
And this is nothing but the principle of superposition for electric fields.

11:29
That means the total electric field at any point is the sum of the electric field produced by each and every charge in the system.

11:37
Now, this summation includes all charges present in the system.

11:40
And gives me the total electric field that is present at this point.

11:47
Remember that if you were to calculate the force on this charge, I must calculate the electric field at this point.

11:54
And in that electric field calculation, I must not include discharge.

11:58
So the electric field here at this point will be electric field produced by all of the charges.

12:02
And if I put a charge coupon here that Cuban charge will we have a force on it and that force will be determined by the electric field produced by all other charges inside the system.

12:14
So this concept of electric wheel is extremely important.

12:18
And as I mentioned that although in electrostatics, I may not really need this.

12:23
But in a later advanced subjects in electromagnetic, this electric field and magnetic fields form very basic foundations of electromagnetism itself.

12:35
So every charge produces in the surrounding an electric wheel.

12:42
And that electric field is felt by any other charge that comes in that in that regional space.

12:50
So whenever you have a space containing electric field, if you put a charge there, they'll be forced on that charge.

12:56
So if the electric field, depending on the direction of electric field, the charge will try to be forced in that to move in that direction.

13:02
And the direction of the force will be the same at the direction of electric field at that point.

13:08
Now I can use this to understand what happens inside a conductor.

13:13
As I mentioned in the first lecture conductors are materials in which there are free electrons, the outermost electrons of the atom are free to move in the entire body of the material.

13:24
And So the electrons can react to any electric field present inside the medium.

13:29
So if you take a conductor, if you take a certain conductor of a certain size, say for example, copper, then so there are three electrons inside electrons that are able to move inside the material.

13:44
If you have an electron here, then if there is an electric field at this point and suppose an electric field is in this direction, the electron will move right move in this direction because it'll be attracted.

13:54
So please remember that because there are free charges present inside the conductor, they will react to any electric field present inside the conductor and move.

14:06
And because currently we are discussing electrostatics, that means a situation when the condition is static, there is no movement of charges.

14:14
Finally, when you reach an equilibrium position, there cannot be any electric field inside the conductor because if there is an electric field inside the conductor, that electric field will push the electron in an appropriate direction.

14:28
And until the electron comes to a position where it cannot move any further.

14:33
So inside the conductor in a static situation, there cannot be any electric wheel at all.

14:41
Now let me for example, calculate suppose I have a charge here say plus five nano kulum and I want to calculate the electric field at a distance of say 1 m from here.

14:56
What is the electric field I want to calculate?

14:58
So I can use this formula E is equal to one by four by epsilon zero Q by R square into a cap.

15:09
So if I define a cap as this direction, then this is nine into 10 or nine into five nano colum minus nine by 1 m square into arca.

15:24
So this is equal to 45.

15:28
Now, the unit of this, as you can see is force per unit charge.

15:31
So you can, you can Coolum later on, we will introduce another unit for electric field.

15:38
So this is 45 newtons per colo and in the direction is arca.

15:43
So in this 1 m distance, there is an electric field of this much.

15:47
So if you happen to put a charge say minus five nano columns here, the force on that will be minus 45 and two 5 to 10 to minus nine which is equal to into 10 to the power nine.

16:07
And as you can see, it is minus a cap direction.

16:10
So there'll be force of attraction here towards the this first charge.

16:14
So given me a charge, I can immediately calculate the electric field.

16:19
And once I know the electric field at this point, I can use the equation for force which is charge times the electric field to calculate the total force on the charge.

16:30
So for example, you can also calculate, I will leave it to you to calculate what is the rectory field produced by minus 59 columns here and calculate the force of on the charge plus five nano columns here and show that Newton third law is valid.

16:46
So I leave it as a problem to you calculate directed field produced by minus five nano columns inside space.

16:52
What is the direct field at this point and calculate the force on the plus five nano column and check whether Newton's third law is valid or not.

17:06
Now, as I was mentioning the concept of concept of electric field is a very important concept that you will be using later on.

17:16
So for example, let me ask the following question, suppose I had two charges fixed charge just so each charge is having some kind of a force on it.

17:27
This charge has a force on this charge.

17:30
This this charge has a force on this charge.

17:32
Now, some of them move the chart to the right now.

17:36
Obviously, the electric field of the charge at this point has increased because the distance has decreased.

17:40
So if I had 1 m and I make it to 50 centimeters, the directory field here has increased by a factor of four because I have reduced the distance by a factor of two, the electric wheel must have increased by a factor of four.

17:53
Now, the question is, when does the charts feel that this charge has moved to its position?

18:01
Now, at this moment, we cannot explain this number here, but we will see later on that this charge will see the effect of this charge after a certain interval of time.

18:13
And that interval is actually an interval which is this distance divided by the speed of light in free space.

18:19
So when I move this charge here, this charge will have will feel an effect of this charge after a time in trouble, which is this distance divided by the speed of light in free space.

18:29
So it's not an instantaneous action and this action is actually so this charge movement creates a disturbance in the electric field which propagates towards this charge.

18:39
And then as it arrives on this charge, this charge has its effects on this charge.

18:43
And this is the electromagnetic field which which we will discuss later on.

18:47
And so electric and magnetic fields have their own real existence.

18:52
They are, they are described by dynamical equations and these equations you will maybe come across a little later in your career when you study more details of electromagnetism itself.

19:05
So these electromagnetic fields can transport energy momentum and so on and so forth.

19:12
Now, electric field is a form of a field called vector field.

19:24
Now what is the field field?

19:26
There is any physical quantity which takes different values at different points.

19:32
So I can for example, describe a field called temperature field.

19:36
So the temperature as a functional position, temperature in the room at a functional position xyz that's called a temperature field.

19:54
And temperature being a scalar quantity is an example of a field called scalar field.

20:02
Similarly, I can describe pressure as a function of position.

20:07
This is called the pressure field.

20:12
It's again a scalar field I can describe suppose for example, I take a water flowing in a river, I can describe a velocity field which is an example of a vector field.

20:42
So these are quantities which is describe how a quantity like temperature or pressure or velocity depend on position.

20:51
In fact, they can also depend on time.

20:52
And in a similar context, we have the concept of electric field.

20:56
So electric field is also a vector field, electric field is also a vector field.

21:01
It can depend on position right now, we are doing static situation.

21:06
So there is no time dependence.

21:07
So this is a vector field also called a here.

21:21
So later on, you will see similarly, I will be able to describe the magnetic field as a function of position and that's another vector field.

21:43
Now it so happens later on, you will see that electric and magnetic fields at any point depend on electric and magnetic fields in the nearby points.

21:51
And you can form differential equations which describe these electromagnetic fields.

21:57
And this is a very elegant representation of electromagnetism itself.

22:03
No, this is fine as electric fields and magnetic fields.

22:09
It was Michael Faraday who introduced a very interesting concept for visualizing this Michael Faraday was a British scientist, he invented what are called as lines of force.

22:33
This is not currently used, we call them as SP lines, s electric field lines, magnetic field lines, etcetera.

22:50
So these are actually trying to visualize represent the fields in space.

22:55
So let me take for example, a positive charge.

23:01
So what I do is the following, I have the expression so to support the charge as its magnitude Q, so I have an expression for the electric field one by four by eps and zero Q by R square A cap.

23:17
So what I do is I calculate, for example, I take this point, I calculate the electric field at this point.

23:23
I know its magnitude from this equation here, I know this distance.

23:27
I know the value of the charge, I know one by 4570.

23:30
So I can calculate this quantity.

23:32
And then I also know the direction and the direction connecting these two.

23:36
So I draw vector here, this vector has a length equal to the magnitude of this electric wheel at this point.

23:44
And the direction is the direction of the electric wheel at that point.

23:49
Now you see here in this equation, the electric field remains the same.

23:54
If R remains the same, the magnitude of electric field is independent is the same for all points having the same R and all points having the same R will lie on a circle around this point, actually a sphere around this point charge.

24:06
So all these points on the circle will have the same magnitude of electric field, but the direction will be different because at this point, the electric field will have this direction at this point, the electric field will have this direction.

24:17
At this point, the electric field will have this direction, they will all have the same magnitude but different directions.

24:24
OK.

24:25
And then I go to a further point.

24:27
So at this point, I know that this distance is larger, so the electric will be smaller and but the direction of the electric field will be in this direction.

24:35
So this will be large, there will be a bigger line here.

24:38
These are large electric fields.

24:40
This is slightly smaller electric fields.

24:41
Similarly, at this distance from here, the electric will be here at this point, electric field will be here at this point, the electric field will be here.

24:49
And then if I go further away here, the be even smaller and the direction will be along the direction joining that point to the charge.

25:01
So please remember these are, these are the fields at this point.

25:06
These lines represent the magnitude of the electric field, the length of the line represents the magnitude of the electric field.

25:12
The tips here, these end points here are the positions where I am drawing the electric field.

25:19
So this is one representation of electric wheels.

25:21
But there's a problem in this that it has a better visual representation of this which I found out which vay discovered or made.

25:31
And that is as follows.

25:32
So what we do is the following, we draw what we call as electric field lines.

25:45
We are, we are such that the tangent through that line gives me the direction of the electric field.

25:57
And we forget about the magnitude field because here, what I'm trying to do is to draw vectors of length equal to the magnitude ve field.

26:06
But let me try to draw another figure and then I will interpret this.

26:09
So I would draw for a positive charge, I draw an electric field like this nice, I draw continuous lines.

26:26
Now, when I draw continuous lines, I have left over the magnitude of the electric field because here in this figure, the magnitude magnitudes were contained in the length of these vectors.

26:38
Here, I have actually joined all the points and I've lost track of that, but I have another point and that is the closer the lines are the stronger the electric wheel is.

26:51
So I represent theoretic field as something like a number of lines crossing per unit area perpendicular to the direction.

27:00
So here, for example, if I have drawn a certain number of lines here, as you go further from the charge, the lines separate out more and more, which means the electric field is decreasing as they move away from the charges.

27:15
As I come closer to the charge, the field lines are getting closer together.

27:19
And that means the electric wheel is getting stronger and stronger.

27:23
Now, this is a two dimensional representation to get the complete three diametral picture, I must rotate this figure and get a complete three dimensional representation.

27:31
That means I will have a sphere with pins coming out in all from all directions of the sphere.

27:39
Now how many lines do I draw?

27:42
I can draw any number of lines.

27:44
If you have a very thin pencil, you can draw a large number of lines and depending on the energy you have.

27:51
But one must make sure that there is consistency.

27:55
So if I draw 20 lines for a charge of a nano colum, I must draw 40 lines for a charge of two nano colum, I must draw 60 lines for a charge of the nano colum.

28:06
So I must make sure that the number of lines I draw is consistent with the charge.

28:12
So larger charges will have a larger number of lines starting.

28:17
So what I've done now is I have replaced individual vectors by lines.

28:23
These lines represent electric wheel lines.

28:27
Please remember these are not any line existing in space.

28:30
These are representations, they're not, there's no line in space.

28:34
These are representations.

28:35
All it implies is that if I look at this point, this point has an electric field like this, this point, there's an electric field like this.

28:43
And the number of lines which are lying here around this point gives me approximately the strength of the electric field.

28:50
So when I hear the field is like this.

28:52
So these lines represent electric field lines and this is a representation, the closer the lines are the stronger the electric field.

29:01
The further the lines are the weaker the electric field.

29:05
Now because of the positive charge points, the lines are facing away from the charge.

29:11
If I take a negative charge, what will happen if I take a negative charge, all the field lines will be pointing towards because you know that electric field is equal to one by four by epsilon zero Q by R squared to R cap.

29:28
So if Q is negative, then the electric field will be in the minus archive direction.

29:33
So for negative charges, I'll draw like this, they will all be coming towards for positive charge, the field lines we're facing away from the positive charge.

29:55
For negative charge, the field lines are all towards the charge.

29:59
So what it implies is if you put a positive charge here, it will be attracted in this direction.

30:04
If you put a positive charge here, it will be attracted in this direction.

30:08
So these are our electric field lines and these represent this, this is a representation which Michael Faraday introduced for a visual representation and they can be used to picture the electric fields in different situations.

30:25
Now this I have drawn two point charges.

30:29
Now let me see what happens because my my problem is not just single point charges, I will have many charges in the system.

30:36
So what will generative field lines look like if I have many charges in my system?

30:40
So let me take an example of two charges, one positive and one negative.

30:46
Let me assume they have the same charts Q and Q.

30:52
So now I want to draw electric field lines.

30:54
So let me take a point this, so let me draw a line here which is the mid midway line.

31:01
So I take a point here at this point, I know that this positive charge creates a field like this and the negative charge creates an field like this, this is on the equatorial line.

31:15
So this distance is equal to this distance.

31:20
So the magnitude of the electric field and the magnitude of the electric field are equal that because this is positive the electric wheel is like this because this is negative electric field is like this.

31:31
The total electric field here is a sum of these two.

31:34
And you can say that this will be like this.

31:36
It is actually the param of forces and the net electric field will be like this.

31:41
So this is the net electric field.

31:44
What about this point to this point?

31:46
You'll have one electric field like this and another electric field like this.

31:50
Please remember this point is farther away from this charge than this charge.

31:55
So this charge will have a stronger electric field here compared to this charge.

31:59
And so if you add param law forces it'll come like this.

32:03
Similarly here, you will have this one producing a chap force like this, this one producing a large force like this.

32:10
And then net force will be like this.

32:13
So what you can see at every point, the magnitude of the fourth the magnitude of the electric field changes and also its direction in a point charge.

32:24
This did not happen in a point charge.

32:27
If I move along this line, the electric field is always pointing away from here.

32:32
Wherever I am here, the situation is different.

32:36
If I move from this point to this point, the electric field line goes from this point this way to this way and to finally this way.

32:42
So now what I do is I drive a car, a dry curve such that this vector is tangent to this curve at this point.

32:55
I draw a curve here such that this vector the total electric wheel is a tangent to this point.

33:00
I draw line curve here so that this net electric wheel is tangent to this line.

33:05
So what I do is I draw a continuous line such that the electric wheel suppose I draw a line like this.

33:13
What it implies is electric wheel at this point is in this direction, electric field in this point is in this direction, electric field here is like this.

33:20
So I'll have another line here.

33:21
For example, this electric field is like this, this is like this, this is like this.

33:26
So these field lines are such that the tangent to the curve at any point represents the direction of the electric wheel at that point.

33:39
And as before the density of these lines, how many lines, whether the lines are close together or far away from each other represents the strength of the electric field.

33:49
So similarly, if I take instead of positive and negative, if I take a positive charge another positive charge, you can see that at this point on the midway line.

33:58
For example, again, like before this field is here like this, this field is like this here, the distance, this distance is equal to this distance.

34:09
So the magnitude of electric field because of this charge at this point is equal to magnitude of electric field at this point because of this charge, both are the same charges and the directions are like this.

34:20
And so the net will be in this direction.

34:24
So we're only here if you calculate this will be like this and this will be like this and the net will be in this direction.

34:31
So this way you can form again set of curves showing the electric field lines.

34:38
So you can if you calculate, for example, here, this will be like this and this this will be like this.

34:45
So the net will be somewhere here like this.

34:47
So you expect lines to curve around these charges.

34:52
And so again, just like before, I'll show you a figure a plots, the curves go like this.

35:09
So these these curves are all electric fields are pointing like this.

35:20
So again, like before at this point, the electric field is like this at this point, the electric field is in this direction at this point, the electric field is in this direction.

35:28
So at any point I draw a tangent to the curve at that point and that tangent gives me the direction of the electric field as we move away from here, the number of lines is decreasing per unit area.

35:40
That means they are getting farther and farther apart.

35:42
So the electric field seems to be decreasing as I move away.

35:45
And if I get closer to the chargers, the electric fields increase.

35:48
So I have actually got some plots of this actual calculation of electric fields of point chargers.

35:56
And I'll show you some slides.

35:58
So let me show you some slides representing field lines for a positive negative charge, a positive positive positive combinations.

36:07
So here is the field which here is the actual plot calculated plot of electric field lines between a positive and a negative charge.

36:15
It's similar to what I tried to draw trying to represent.

36:18
So what it implies is that at this point, the electric field is tenant to this point of the curve which is like this here.

36:26
From somewhere here, the field will be like this at this point on this line.

36:32
They are like this actually, there should be arrows on these curves.

36:34
These arrows are all going from positive to negative charges.

36:38
And as you can see here, I've taken the same number of lines starting from a positive charge and they're all ending on negative charge.

36:45
So as I discussed earlier, electric speed lines start from a positive charge and either end on a negative charge or 10 to infinity go to infinity.

36:55
Similarly, all all electric field lines will come in convert to a negative charge either from another positive charge or from infinity.

37:04
So that's a pair of positive and negative charges.

37:07
This is of equal magnitude.

37:10
This is called an electric dipole.

37:12
We will calculate actual electric fields of these dipoles a little later.

37:17
So as you can see here, these represent electric field lines.

37:21
And this is what far at that time had tried to introduce.

37:24
And now these are very nice representations of electric fields.

37:29
And as you can see here, the two field lines, the two charges seem to be attracting.

37:34
As you can see here, they are trying to be pulling each other.

37:37
If you look at two positive charges, the field lines are very different from this pair of positive and negative charges.

37:42
You can see here, they look like attacking each other.

37:45
These look like repelling each other.

37:47
So the director field lines are different here.

37:49
Here, the field lines start from both the positive charges and go towards infinity.

37:54
There's no convergence.

37:55
Actually, they finally go up to infinity and stop there.

37:59
Let me show you another figure three positive charges.

38:03
So what we do is we calculate electric field at every point draw curves such that at any point, the direction of electric field is tangent to that point to that curve.

38:13
So here for example, the electric field will be tangent to this curve here at this point, director field be tangent to the curve at this point somewhere here, there will be tangent to this curve at that point and so on.

38:25
So I can draw field lines like this for a combination like this or two positive and non negative charge and so on and so forth.

38:31
So this is an interesting way to visualize electric fields between charges and this is one representation which can be very useful.

38:41
Now, I must mention I must caution against you're assuming that these electric field lines are not lines of constant electric field.

38:55
They do not represent lines of constant electric field as you move along the line, the electric field changes as you move along any of these lines, the electric field itself be changing as a fox position.

39:05
So the directory field strength is represented by the spacing between these.

39:09
How many lines are there close by here?

39:11
The director field strength is larger because there are lines are closer here here.

39:14
The director field strength is smaller because the lines are farther away and so on.

39:18
So these lines do not represent lines of constant directory field.

39:22
That's one point that you must remember.

39:25
The second point is if I put a charge here, do not make a mistake that the charge will go along the curve.

39:35
If I put a charge here, a positive charge, the charge will be acted upon by an electric field in this direction tangent to the curve.

39:43
And then that particular force will accelerate or accelerate or whatever it is to the charge, there'll be forced on the charge.

39:50
So if you put a charge on, on at this point, it is not, it is not, it's not that the charge moves along this line, it doesn't move along that line.

39:58
Except of course, in this, in the case of a single charge, if you take a single post charge, if you take a single positive charge and put, put a charge on one of the lines here, if you put a charge here, if you put a positive charge, it will move along this line.

40:13
If you put a negative charge, it will move along this line towards this but not in general, not in general situations.

40:19
These lines do not represent curves where the charges will move.

40:23
So for a given electrical distribution at any point, I know the total electric field that total electric field will give me a force on any charge.

40:33
And that force I use in Newton's laws to describe the motion of that particle.

40:43
OK.

40:45
No, this particular rep so, ok, let me recall again, editor field lines start from positive charges, electric field lines end on negative charges.

40:59
So the charges starting from positive either go towards a negative charge or go towards infinity.

41:04
Similarly charges negative charges.

41:07
The field lines converge to the negative charge either from a positive charge or from infinity.

41:13
Second thing I must also again remember that electric field lines never cross each other because if an electric field line crosses, suppose I have one electric field like like this another one like this, what is the direction of electric field here is a tangent to this curve.

41:28
Art is a tangent to this curve.

41:30
Obviously, electric field cannot have two different orientations at one point.

41:34
So electric field lines never cross each other as you have seen in the figures, the electric field lines do not cross and because the electric field at any point is a unique direction, OK.

41:49
So let's start calculating, for example, let's take an electric what is called an electric dipole.

42:07
An electric dipole is a pair of charges which I ruled earlier, a positive or negative charge.

42:18
Let me do this, let me draw the other way around.

42:20
So this is negative, this is positive.

42:22
OK.

42:23
So same, same charge as Q and Q, so minus Q and plus Q.

42:31
So let me draw the X axis here.

42:35
And let me try to calculate what is the electric field because of this pair of charges.

42:42
So I can actually calculate electric field at any point.

42:46
But for simplicity, let me start with calculating electric bill at some point P here.

42:50
And let me assume the distance of this point.

42:53
So this is origin, let me assume this distance is X.

43:00
OK.

43:02
And let me assume that this separation is two A.

43:07
So two charges plus Q and minus Q kept at a separation of two A.

43:15
And I'm trying to calculate the electric field along the line joining the two charges.

43:21
So I take a point B we just had a distance X from the center of these two charges.

43:26
So this is my xxx axis and there's no BIIS here.

43:33
OK.

43:34
So the electric field at this point, the total electric field is the electric field because of plus Q plus electric field.

43:44
Decor so minus Q, please remember superposition principle electric field at this point, total electric field at this point is electric field at this point because of plus charge plus electric field at this point because of minus charge, the presence of plus charge does not affect the electric field created by the negative charge here.

44:03
Similarly, the presence of negative charge does not affect the electric field created by the positive charge at this point.

44:10
So what are the electric fields?

44:11
So E plus Q is equal to one by four by epsilon zero Q by this distance is squared this distance square.

44:24
So that is X minus A or square and this in the direction I cap OK.

44:32
I must clarify something here in an earlier lecture I had used X CAPP.

44:38
This is the same as ICAP Pica is the same as JCA.

44:43
And Z cap is the same as KCA unit vectors.

44:48
Unit vector along the X direction is ICAP or X cap unit vector along the Y direction is JCA or Y cap unit vector on the Z direction is KCA or Z cap.

44:59
So you should get used to the notations.

45:01
Sometimes people use ICAP JCA, Z cap.

45:04
Sometimes people use this X cap, Y cap, Z cap.

45:06
So they represent unit vectors along the XY and Z directions.

45:12
So E plus Q is given by this.

45:14
And what about E minus Q one bite four pipes island zero, you bye this distance square and that distance is X plus A and so this electric field plus Q is this direction and minus Q is in this direction.

45:36
So minus ICAP.

45:44
So the plus charge creates an electric field towards the plus X axis.

45:47
Here, the minus charge creates an electric field in this direction.

45:50
So the total electric wheel let's calculate E is equal to E plus Q plus E minus Q which is equal to one by four by epsilon zero.

46:06
You bye X minus a full square, Y cap minus one by 4570, Q by X plus A or square I cap which is still by 45 eps and zero one by X minus a whole square minus one by X plus a whole square I cap which is equal to Q by 4570.

46:38
So this is nothing but X plus a whole square minus X minus a whole square divided by X plus a whole square into X minus a whole square I which is actually Q by 45 R zero, A plus B squared minus A minus B squared is four X A divided by this is X square minus a square square.

47:13
So that's the electric field at that point with coordinate the distance X from the, from the center.

47:21
And as you can see here for charge for points here, the net electric field is given by this and the direction of the electric vector is along the X axis as expected because the two electric fields both because of positive and negative charges are along the X axis either plus X axis or minus X axis.

47:41
And the sum of these two vectors is also along the X axis.

47:45
So as X increases the strength of the electric, we keep from decreasing.

47:50
If I take a distance X which is much, much greater than A, if I take a distance X much, much greater than A, then E will be approximately two by four by epsilon zero four Xa I can neglect A in comparison to X, I'll get X four into IC which is actually Q by 45 sin and zero, OK, four X A four A SP X.

48:28
So let me write this like this.

48:30
So this is Q times two A sp two pi epsilon zero.

48:39
I can I purposely written like this Q is the charge plus Q and minus Q and two ways.

48:47
The separation between the two charges, as you can see here, there's major geometry here.

48:51
The charges are plus two and minus Q two ways.

48:54
The separation between the two charges, this particular quantity Q times two A is called, is given a name, it's called dial moment.

49:03
And the dial moment is a vector.

49:06
It is written as a vector from the minus minus charge to plus charge.

49:11
So it is given a small sign here PP vector.

49:15
So I define the dial moment.

49:29
So it is a vector.

49:31
That pole moment is a vector which has a magnitude of charge times the separation between them.

49:40
And the direction of the dipole moment is from the negative charge of positive charge.

49:46
Now, I'll a little later, I'll tell you the importance of these dipoles.

49:50
But what we have seen is here that the electric wheel of the dipole keeps on decreasing as you move away from the, from the dipole and it decreases in the following fashion.

50:04
So I can write this as P the movement discounted A Q times 28 times I cap and C vector.

50:20
And by 2550 XQ So one thing to note here is that for a point charge, the electric field decreased as one by distance square.

50:35
So what is XX is the distance of this point from the center of the dipole?

50:43
Because along the X axis, I'm calculating X here.

50:46
So for the dipole, the electric field decreases as one by X cube.

50:53
If I had a positive charge only along the x direction, suppose I take a positive charge and look at the electric field along the X direction.

51:01
How will it decrease?

51:02
So if I had a positive charge, if I had only a positive charge here, and this is X axis.

51:10
So from this distance is X, the electric field will decrease as qy 45 S and zero X squared into I cap.

51:21
So the retro field will decrease as X squared for a point charge, it decreases the text cube for a dipole.

51:27
So the decrease in the electric wheel is much faster.

51:32
In fact, if your separation between the two charges keeps on decreasing, the dipole moment keeps on decreasing.

51:40
And so what is actually happening is if you are very far from the dipole, the electric fields of the positive and negative charges become almost equal and they are in opposite directions.

51:53
So they try to cancel us.

51:54
So the electric field decreases much faster.

51:57
So we will end a class here.

51:58
What I will do in the next class is to calculate the electric field on this equatorial plane, I would like to calculate what is the electric field here because of plus Q sorry minus Q and plus Q separated by distance two A and this is the y axis and this is x axis.

52:16
So I'm going to calculate at a point B the total electric field.

52:20
And again, we will see that the electric field will decrease as the cube of the distance of this, of this point from the typo.

52:28
Yeah, at the end, I want to leave a problem for you to think about.

52:35
It's a simple problem.

52:37
So write an expression four D electric wheels produced by a point charge placed at a point it coordinates X zero Y zero a six year old.

53:25
So here is my plane here is, so this is my point charge here plus Q for example, the coordinate is X zero by zero.

53:36
There you go.

53:39
So right, the electric field as a function of XYZ.

53:50
Thank you.
Transcript_02-Electrostatic Potential and Capacitance (XII)_IIT_PAL_04-07:
video_04:
0:43
Good morning to all of you.

0:46
Today, we will continue with our discussion on electrostatics.

0:51
Let's recall that in the last lecture we had discussed about capacitance and capacitors.

0:59
So let me recall, a capacitance is a device which consists of two conductors which are separated by a dielectric or air and carrying equal and opposite charges.

1:14
So if you shift some electrons from one conductor to another conductor, then one of the conductors gets positively charged, the other conductor gets negatively charged and they are separated by a certain distance.

1:26
And this unit forms a capacitor and this capacitance as we will see stores energy, electrostatic energy, which can be used for various purposes.

1:39
And capacitors form a very, very important component of all electronic circuits.

1:47
Charging of a capacitor means you take a capacitor and connect a battery to it.

1:52
And in that process transfer electrons from one conductor to the other conductor and that leads to a charging.

1:58
And then if you disconnect your capacity battery, then the capacitor remains charged.

2:04
We had calculated as an example, we started looking at a parallel plate capacitor.

2:12
So parallel plate capacitor consists of two plates of area a separated by distance D.

2:33
So let me draw three dimensional figure here.

2:35
So there are two plates here, one plate here, another plate.

2:39
And so you may have positive charges on the upper plate, the lower plate is negatively charged.

2:52
And in between these two plates, there is an electric field pointing like this.

2:57
And so area is of this place is A and D is the separation.

3:02
So in this example, the upper plate is carrying positive charge, the lower plate is car carrying negative charge.

3:08
And we had calculated the capacitance of this device D is the separation between the plates is the area of the plates and epsilon zero is the permittivity of free space.

3:19
And the unit of capacitance is, and you can see that ferret is a unit, which is because C is Q by V capacitance has kum per volt.

3:48
One ferret is one colum per volt that fro comes from Michael's name and that's the unit of capacitance.

3:56
Fro is a very large capacitance.

3:58
Typically in circuits we use micro Ferres or of we are also looking at an example and shown that Eyal capacitance you can get about 10 Pierres.

4:14
Now today, what I want to do is to discuss some more examples of capacitance.

4:20
And as the next example, we will take a cylindrical capacitor.

4:33
So you can imagine and a central conductor surrounded by another conductor in the form of a cylinder.

4:42
And if I draw the cross section I have the central conductor here and the outside conductor.

4:48
So we draw a thickness of the conductor here.

4:51
So this is one conductor here.

4:53
This is another conductor and I want I let me call this radius coaxial.

5:01
So this is radius A and this radius is B, the outer radius, the radius of the inner conductor is a, the radius of the inner surface of the outer conductor is B.

5:14
So let me assume that the inner conductor is positively charged and there is an equal amount of negative charge on the auto conductor.

5:31
So what I need to calculate to calculate capacitance is a relationship between the voltage between the two cap two conductors and the charge in the two conductors.

5:41
Because that proportionality constant gives me the capacitance.

5:45
So to calculate voltage, I need to know the electric field, we have already done this before.

5:50
So for calculating electric field, what I do is I take a Gaussian surface of radius R and of length L.

5:58
So if the, if the cylinder is like this, if the inner conductor is here an outer conductor is like this, I will take a Gaussian surface of length L we just linked L and of radius R from the center.

6:14
So and we have already discussed by symmetry arguments, the electric field will be radial away from the center.

6:24
So and so there is no Gaussian flux, electric flux on the top and bottom surface of the cylinder of the Gaussian surface, there is only flux from the cylindrical surface.

6:34
So whose area is two by R into L into electric field is a flux must be equal to the charge contained.

6:41
So if I assume that lambda is the charge per unit length, so the charge contained the lambda into L by epsilon zero, Lambda is the charge per unit length.

6:50
So so much length of the conductor contains lambda charge.

6:54
So electric field becomes lambda by two by epsilon zero R.

6:59
This we've already calculated before and because the electric field is in the radial direction from the axis outwards, I can write the electric field as E is equal to this in a cap.

7:11
So that's the electric field on of the of the this configuration of one conductor cylindrical conductor surrounded by another cylindrical conductor.

7:21
Now I need to calculate the potential difference between the outer and inner conductors.

7:26
So we know how to calculate potential differences.

7:29
So let me calculate the potential difference V is equal to V of the inner conductor minus V of the ultra conductor.

7:47
So which is equal to minus integral B to A E dot Dr which is equal to lambda by four pi two pipes and, and zero in two A to B, they are by R which is equal to lambda by two pi epsilon zero and two log of feel like.

8:18
So that's a potential difference between the inner and outer conductors.

8:25
So the inter inter conductor is at a higher potential, it's positively charged.

8:28
So the inner conductor is at a higher potential compared to the conductor.

8:32
Now, I want to write this in terms of the total charge.

8:36
So if I take a length L, the charge will be, is equal to lambda into L.

8:49
So I replace lambda by Q by L in this equation.

8:51
And I get the following equation V is equal to Q by two pi epsilon zero L into a log be right there.

9:07
And so because we know that B is equal to Q by C, we can define the capacitance of this configuration.

9:18
C is equal to two pi eps and zero LY log bye.

9:29
That is the capacitance of a length of the of this cylindrical capacitor.

9:34
We can define a capacitance per unit length is equal to C by L which is equal to two by epsilon zero by Ln of B by A.

9:55
So as you can see here, the capacitance only depends on the geometric parameters for a parallel plate capacitor.

10:01
It was epsilon zero A by D here, the capacitance per unit length, please remember this is capacitance per unit length of the cylindrical conductor, cylindrical capacitor.

10:11
And this, the capacity per unit length is given by 2570 by log B.

10:15
By now, let me take some examples here.

10:29
Let me take an inner radius of two millimeters, an outer radius of four millimeters And so the capac 10 C is equal to two pi epsilon zero by Ellen B by A which is equal to two pi into 8.85 into 10 to the minus 12 by Ellen of four by two.

10:57
And you can estimate this to be approximately equal to 80 PICO which is actually 82 tenders for minus 12 are red.

11:12
Sure.

11:13
So what it implies is if you take 1 m length of this cable of this cylindrical capacitor, it will have a capacitance of 80 PICO ferrets.

11:24
You must have seen such a cylindrical conductors, cylindrical capacitors that are, that are used for connecting television and VCRS through cables.

11:34
And those cables are called coaxial cables have a typical capacitance of about se 70 per.

11:51
There are also insulators within the between the conductors there.

11:55
So we are right now assuming that the two conductors are separated by free space.

11:59
So that's an example of a cylindrical capacitor and this capacitance which we have written here is the capacitance per unit length of this cylindrical capacity.

12:11
Let me take another example, historical catastrophe.

12:29
Spherical capacitor consists of one inner spherical conductor surrounded by and spherical conductor.

12:44
The inner sphere is charged positively assumed to be charged positively.

12:49
The outer sphere is assumed to be charged negatively and same charge is put on the inner and outer spherical conductor.

13:01
Let me assume that the radius of inners sphere is equal to R A and radius of out of there is equal to RB.

13:29
So as as you can see here, there are electric wheel lines now going from positive to negative.

13:35
So I need to again just like before calculate the potential difference between the in out outer and inner conductor and find out how that is related to the charge contained in the capacitors in the in the conductors.

13:49
So let me assume the charges are capital Q and minus Q here plus Q and minus Q which are put on the inner and outer conductors to calculate potential difference, I must calculate the electric field which you have done before.

14:04
But let me recall, I take a Gaussian surface of a spherical surface of radius are centered at the center of the inner conductor sphere.

14:14
And so by symmetry, as we have seen before, the electric field lines are all radial pointing away from the center.

14:22
So the electric flux is equal to four pi R square into A E is an ideal electric field.

14:34
And so it is four pipes R squared into E and the charge contained as capital Q.

14:39
So by, by Gauss's law, we have four pr square E is equal to Q by epsilon zero or electric field is equal to Q by four pi epsilon zero R square.

14:54
And because the electric field is radial, I will write this as OK.

14:59
So that's the electric field which we've already seen before the electric field of the spherical conductor here is exactly like that of a point charge at the center of the spherical conductor.

15:09
Please note here that the ultra conductor is also charged.

15:12
But the electric field of the ultra conducting charge is zero inside inside this volume.

15:18
The only electric field that exists here is because of the positive charge here, their outer charges do not contribute to the electric field within.

15:26
But the electric field lines are starting from the inner conductor and ending on the outer conductor.

15:32
So once having calculated the electric field, I can now calculate the potential difference.

15:48
So V is equal to minus integral RB to R A E dot Dr which is equal to integral Q by four by epsilon zero R square Dr R A to RB which is equal to Thank you.

16:11
Bye.

16:12
Four pipes are in zero minus the one by R R eight RB which is equal to Q by 45 S 01 by R A minus one by R.

16:33
And I can write this as V is equal to Q by 45 SN zero RB minus R A by RARB.

16:50
So that is the potential difference between the inner and outer conductors.

16:54
Capital Q is the charge carried by the conductors.

16:56
So the capacitance of this device C is equal to Q by B which is equal to 45 epsilon zero RARB, it's like RB minus Rh.

17:20
So that's the capacitance of this spherical capacitor.

17:24
So the spherical capacitor has an inner sphere conductor, spherical conductor of radius R A surrounded by an outer spherical conductor of radius RP both conductors carry the same amount of charge capital Q.

17:38
And this particular device forms a capacitor with the capacitance of this value.

17:45
And this gives me the capacities of this configuration.

17:48
I can also look at the following situation where if I let the radius of the outer conductor go to infinity.

17:57
If I let the radius RB go to infinity, that the radius allow conductor go to infinity, I will get the capacitance of a single sphere of charge of radius R A.

18:07
So limit RB 10 infinity capac becomes 45 eps and zero into R A.

18:24
That is the capacitance of a single sphere conducting sphere of radius R A, the other conductor which is supposed to be carrying negative charges as infinite size.

18:35
So that's the capacitance of a of a sphere.

18:38
So as an example, let's take, let's look at a sphere spherical capacitor with R A is equal to one millimeter and RB physical infinity.

19:00
So C is equal to four pi epsilon zero R A which is equal to 10 to the minus three by nine or 10 for nine, which is about 0.11 PICO ferret, which is actually 0.11 into tenders to minus 12.

19:27
So that's the capacitance of a sphere of radius one millimeter.

19:31
So if I put a charge of one PICO, then the voltage generated B is equal to Q by C which is equal to 10 to the minus 12 by 0.11 into 10 to minus 12, which is about nine volts.

20:08
So if I put one PICO colum of charge on this sphere of spherical conductor of radius, one millimeter, I will develop a voltage of nine volts.

20:18
And you can beyond this point, you can calculate what is the electric field of this spherical capacitor, et cetera, et cetera.

20:25
I leave that problem to you.

20:26
And you can calculate this.

20:29
In fact, I can also calculate the electric field, the capacitance of a of a large object like the earth, the capacity of the earth.

20:51
So to do this, we assume the earth to be spherical, the radius of the earth is 6371 kilometers.

21:10
And so the capacitance is equal to four pi epsilon zero into the radius which is equal to 6.3716 by nine or 10.9 which is about 7.08 into 10 to the minus four thread which is actually 708 micro.

21:39
So that's the capacity of the earth, such a large object as the earth has the capacitance of about 700 microts.

21:46
So you can imagine the fro is actually very, very large unit.

21:50
And typically we are dealing with Picot and NANOS and all micros of capacitance So as we have seen in the three examples, the planar plant parallel plate capacitor, the cylindrical capacitor and the spherical capacitor.

22:05
The capacitance of these devices is a purely geometric quantity determined by the size shape and separation between the pair of conductors which form the capacitors.

22:18
So in principle, you can calculate the capacitance of different kind of configurations, but we will restrict these three configuration because you can actually numerically analytically evaluate these numbers.

22:30
Otherwise, if you have more complex geometries, one would have to do a numerical simulation to calculate the capacitance.

22:39
Now, in many situations, I would need capacitance of certain values in circuit design as you will see later on in some of your later studies, but I may have capacity of only certain known values.

22:53
So how do I form capacitance of other other other numbers, other values?

22:58
So I can use capacitance as in parallel or in series.

23:01
So what I want to do is to study now capac tens or capacitors connected in cities and in parallel.

23:25
So I can actually connect many capacitors either in CD or parallel.

23:29
So for example CD would imply that I have one capacity here, another capacity here, another capacity here.

23:36
This is a two point.

23:37
So I can have capacity C one capacity C two capacitor C three.

23:42
So this is a series connection.

23:45
They're all in series one after the other, I can have also a situation where I have a capacitor like this another capacity like this, a third capac like this.

24:00
So C one C two CT.

24:05
So these are the points which are connecting, these are capacitors in parallels.

24:16
In fact, I can mix these two configurations, I can have some capacitors in series, some capacitors in parallel.

24:21
So the objective is now to find out what is this equivalent to what kind of capacity is equivalent to.

24:28
So I would like to replace all the three capacitor, this this device consisting of three capacitors by a single equivalent capacitor.

24:35
So my objective now is to calculate what is the equivalent capacitor of a series of capacitors connected in series or a series of capacitors connected in parallel.

24:45
And we will look at an example which actually contains both such configurations.

24:49
So let me look at first capacitors connected in cities capacity is connected in series.

25:05
So let me read all the figure again here.

25:07
So I have one cap pastor, another cap pastor, another cap pastor.

25:14
And the way we charge the capacitor is to connect a battery.

25:19
So please remember the battery is drawn with two unequal lines and the capacitors are all drawn with two equal lines.

25:26
So let me call this capacity C one, this capacity C two, this capacity C three, let me denote by the voltage across the capacitance V.

25:35
One voltage is V two here and voltage V three and with the voltage applied by the battery.

25:45
So the potential difference between these two points must be total V.

25:51
So what I get immediately is the potential difference V must be equal to V one plus V two plus V three.

26:01
V one is the potential difference between these two points.

26:04
V two is the potential difference between these two points.

26:06
We see the potential difference between these three points, these two points.

26:09
So the potential difference between these two points, which is essentially the potential difference between the two terminals of the battery is V one plus V two plus V three.

26:18
So if I add the potentials, I will get the total potential difference between the two terminals or the battery, which is what I have as we.

26:27
So we want to understand what happens when the battery is connected to the capacitors.

26:32
So we have a pos this is the positive side of the battery.

26:35
This is a negative side.

26:36
So the positive side is connected to the upper plate of this capacitor.

26:39
C one which is then connected to C two, which is connected to C three.

26:43
So let us see what happens when the battery is connected.

26:47
The positive charge of the battery pulls electrons from the upper plate of the catastrophe one.

26:53
And so the upper plate of the catastrophe one gets charged positively.

27:00
So this induced positive charge actually creates a negative charge on the lower plate of the capacity C one.

27:09
Now this negative charge on the lower plate of C one is actually created by pulling electrons from the upper plate of C two, which then gets positively charged.

27:20
And this one then makes the lower plate of C two to have negative charges.

27:25
And this negative charge now pull the electrons from the upper plate of C three and leaves it positively charged, which then can makes the lower plate of C three to be negatively charged.

27:39
So let us see what happens.

27:40
So as soon as I connect the positive side of, of the battery to the catastrophe, one, the positive side pulls electrons from the upper plate leaving net positive charge on the appro plate of capacity C one which then makes the lower plate of C one to have negative charges which are coming from the upper plate of C two, which then leaves the upper plate of capacity C two to be positively charged.

28:03
Then that makes the lower plate of C two to have negative charges which then makes the upper plate of C three positively charged and the lower plate of C three negatively charged.

28:14
So what is now happening is that let us now try to see what happens in this part of the circuit which I draw by a dash dot red line here.

28:26
Now in this part of the circuit, look here that the lower plate of C one and the upper plate of C two are connected to each other through this conducting wire and they are not connected to any part of the circuit, any other part of the circuit.

28:39
So the net charge within this must be equal to zero.

28:43
So whatever charge you have here must have the same but opposite charge on the lower plate.

28:48
And this charge is actually equal to the charge on the upper plate of the capacity C one.

28:52
And so whatever charge has been supplied by the battery, which is plus Q here is also inducing a minus Q on the lower plate.

29:00
So if this is plus Q here, this is minus Q on the lower plate of the capacitor, C one which then induces plus Q on the upper plate of C two, which then induces minus Q on the lower plate of C two, which then induces plus Q on the upper plate of C three and finally minus Q on the lower plate of C three.

29:24
So what has actually happened is the battery has only supplied a charge Q and that charge Q is now the same in all the capacitors, C one C two and C three.

29:35
So the net charge supplied by the capacitor is only Q.

29:46
And this charge is the same in all the capacitors because they are connected in series.

29:51
So let us see what happens.

29:52
This battery.

29:53
When I connect the positive charge of the battery positive terminal to the capacitor, then it induces positive charge.

30:00
Here, it pulls electrons from the upper plate.

30:02
It induces that it gives the charge plus two on the upper plate which then induces A minus Q on the lower plate, which is, which then has a plus Q on the upper plate of C two, which has a minus Q on the lower plate of C two, A plus Q on the upper plate of C three and A minus Q on the lower plate of C three.

30:17
So please note here that all the capacitors are carrying the same charge Q which is the charge supplied by the battery.

30:27
So if each of the capacitors has a charge, Q, then I can write the following equation for the voltages across each capacitor.

30:34
So I called V one as the voltage across this capacitor V two is the potential difference across this capacitor.

30:40
V three is the potential difference across this capacitor.

30:42
So this capacitor has a charge Q A capacity C one and a voltage V one.

30:48
So V one must be equal to Q one by Q by C one V two, which is the potential difference across this plate of the capacitor.

30:56
V two must be equal to Q by C two.

31:00
And similarly with three, the potential difference across this capacitor must be with three is equal to Q by C three.

31:07
So the total potential difference is V one plus two plus V three.

31:11
Each of the capacitors has a voltage V one which is Q by C one V two, which is Q by C two and V three, which is Q by C three.

31:19
And, but C one, C two, C three are the three capacitors.

31:22
And as I have used the fact that all the capacitors have the same charge Q supplied to them.

31:28
And this is the D charge supplied by the battery.

31:30
So with these two equations, this equation and this equation, I can combine to form an equation which tells me the overall capacity of the device V is equal to V one plus V two plus V three, which is equal to Q by C one plus Q by C two plus Q by CT.

31:58
So I want to replace this by.

32:00
So I, what I'm trying to do is to find out the equivalent capacitance.

32:03
So I have these three capacitors here.

32:07
So C one C two C three potentially.

32:11
So I'm trying to find out what is that capac which is equal to this, if I call this capacity C, what is the value of C for which this, this and this are exactly equivalent.

32:27
So this is V and the charge is Q.

32:29
So this capacity C must be equal to Q by B and I can get from.

32:38
So this I can use this equation to find out V by Q is equal to one by C one plus one by C two plus one by C three.

32:51
And as you can see here, C is Q by B.

32:54
So this is equal to one by C, it is equal to one by C one plus one by C two plus one by C three.

33:06
So if you have three capacitors in parallel in cities like this, the total capacitance or the equivalent capacitance of this is actually one by C one plus one by C two plus one by C three and inverse of that.

33:18
So one by C which is C is the equivalent capacitance is one by C one plus one by C two plus one by CT.

33:25
So for example, if I had a, a capacity of 10 micro ferrets and a capacitance of two micro ferrets connected like this, the total capacity will be such that I have one by C is equal to one by 10 plus one by two which is equal to 12 by 20.

33:48
So C is equal to 20 by 12.

33:53
So this is all micro micro feathers.

33:59
So the capacitance is add in such a fashion this through this kind of equation.

34:02
So given any sequence of capacitance which are connected in cities, I can calculate the capacitance.

34:08
So I can actually write a generalized equation which is the following.

34:12
So if I had and capacitors connected in series, the equal and capacity is equal to Sigma, I is equal to 12 N one bye C I.

34:34
So which is actually equal to one by C one plus one by C two plus one by that is the total capacitance.

34:45
So I can use this formula to calculate the capacitance of a series of capacitors which are connected in series.

34:54
Now I want to discuss what happens to capac tensors connected in parallel.

35:13
So let me consider the following circuit here.

35:16
So I have so C one C two CT B is the potential applied across the three capacitors.

35:32
The three capacitors are connected in parallel.

35:36
You can see that the potential difference between these two points is V between these two points is V and these are all connected by conductors.

35:43
So this is also V, this potential difference is also V.

35:45
So all capacitors have a potential difference of me.

36:09
Now let me assume charge on C one is it called Q one charge on C two is equal to Q two and charge on CT is equal to you.

36:32
So please remember in this case, the potentials across all the capacitors are the same, but this battery has to supply a charge Q one to this capacitor, a charge Q two to this capacitor and a charge Q three to this capacitor.

36:44
So the total charge supplied by the capacitor by the, by the battery, Q is equal to Q one plus Q two plus Q three.

37:05
And we know that because I've assumed that the potential the, the, the charge QC, the charge Q one is on capacity.

37:14
C one, Q two is on C two, Q three is on C three.

37:17
I have the following three equations I have Q one is equal to C one V, Q two is equal to C two V and Q three is equal to C three V, same potential different capacities and different charges.

37:33
So I get Q is equal to C one plus C two plus C three and two B.

37:42
So now as before, if I want to replace the three panel capacitors by a single capacitor, so I have the three capacitors here.

37:51
So I want to make it equivalent to a single capas can see just the C one C two C three B is the potential difference Q is the charge on the supplied by the battery.

38:06
So C must be equal to Q by V Q by sorry small cube.

38:14
So I can use these two equations to get the capacitance equal and capacitance CS C one plus C two plus CT.

38:29
So when I connect capacitance in parallel three, capacitance is in parallel, the total capacitance is C one plus two plus three.

38:40
If I connect connect the same capacitance as in series, the net capacitance is C which is one by C is grown by C one plus one by C two plus one by C three.

38:47
So the, the way the capacitors add to give an equal in capacitance depends on the way you connect them.

38:54
So in general, for N capacitors in parallel C is equal to Sigma, I is equal to 12 N C I.

39:14
The total capacitance is simply the sum of the capacitance capac capacitance of each of the capacitor.

39:19
So if in the earlier example, I had taken two capacitance, two capacitors of capacitance 10 micro fits and two micro fits.

39:29
So if I were to connect them now in parallel, so this is 10 micro ferre and this is two micro ferre, the total capacitance C is equal to 10 plus two.

39:51
So by these configurations, you can actually achieve capacitance which you want in a circuit by putting Capris, which you have in parallel or in series and you can have multiple combinations to achieve capacitance that you desire.

40:11
So to look at another example in which I can have, I want to show you that it is possible that in a circuit there are capacitance both in cities and parallel.

40:21
So let me look at the following example.

40:27
So I have the following circuit.

40:29
So I have one capacitor here, then I have pastor.

40:43
So this is C one C two city.

40:48
So now it's a more complicated circuit.

40:50
I have these two capacitors are in parallel and this combination is now in series with the other capacitor.

40:58
So my problem is now to find out what is the equivalent capacity of this, that means what is the capacity between these two points?

41:08
So what I will do is I can use the per the discussion that we have had first.

41:13
What I will do is I will use the parallel, these two capacitors to be in parallel and, and equate this to another circuit, another circuit where I have C one and another capacitor here.

41:26
So I will replace these two capacitors by an equal and capacitor here.

41:29
So I have C one and let me call it C 23.

41:33
So first, I look at the parallel combination and find the equal and capacitor, this equal capacitor is now in series with this capacitor.

41:42
So this becomes equal to a cap.

41:49
So these two are in parallel to give me an equal and capacity C 23, then C 23 is in series with C one to get me the total capacitance C equal capacity between these two terminals.

41:59
So let me try to apply this this so first let me calculate C 23.

42:04
So to calculate C 23, remember these C two and C three are in parallel.

42:09
So C 23 must be equal to C two plus C three.

42:15
Remember capas add up like this.

42:19
So the equal equal capacitor C 23 is C two plus C three.

42:24
So what I get is this important device now here.

42:28
So this is, so this is C one and this is C two plus CT.

42:35
So the equal in capacity now C is equal to is given by one by C is equal to one by C one plus one by C two plus C three.

42:49
So I can solve this equation to get me equal in capacity.

42:53
So let me take an ex the following example.

42:55
So let me take C one is equal to 25 micro C two is equal to five micro ferret and C three is equal to 20 micro ferrets.

43:09
So C 23 is equal to C two plus C three which is 25 micro ferret.

43:19
So this parallel combination of C two and C three gives me one equal and capacitor which has a capacity of 25 micro.

43:29
So now I have is a series combination of 25 micro, another 25 micro.

43:35
And remember that for C I have one by C is equal to one by C one plus one by C 23, which is equal to one by 25 plus one by 25 which is equal to two by 25.

43:51
So C is equal to 25 by two which is 12.5 micro.

44:01
So this combination of circuits in which I had, this was 25 micro C two was five micro and C three was 20 micro Ferri.

44:17
The equivalent capacitance of this configuration is actually 12.5 micro.

44:21
So this configuration will will behave as if there was a capacitance of 12.5 micron.

44:27
So please note, I have been able to generate a 12.5 micro Ferra capacitance by adding capacitance is a 25 micro Ferri five micro Ferri and 20 micro Ferri in such a combination that I get 12.5 micro Ferri, I will leave the problem to you.

44:44
You can actually exchange these capacitance in different combinations and find out what are the all possible capacitance that you can generate with these three capacitors.

44:54
For example, you can have all three of them in cities, all three of them in parallel two of them in series and one in parallel and parallel to the other one, et cetera, et cetera.

45:04
So I leave the problem to you.

45:05
You please try to find out all kinds of combinations of these three capacitance capacitors which can lead you to different different capacitance values.

45:14
And that will give you an indication of how I'm able to generate different different capacitance from these three capacitance.

45:22
Now let me continue with the same problem and find out the following.

45:25
So I have this capac here and I had these two caps.

45:35
So this was C one C two C three.

45:40
Now let me assume I apply a potential difference of 10 volts.

45:48
So V is equal to 10 volts.

45:52
So I want to calculate how many, how much charge are the, how much is the charge in each of these capacitors?

45:58
And what are the potential differences?

46:03
So what is the charge supplied by the capacity by the battery?

46:07
Q is equal to the net capacitance, the voltage which is 12.5 micro to 10 volts which is equal to 1 25 micro colum.

46:23
So the battery has supplied 1 25 micro colum to charge these capacitors.

46:29
Now this 125 matter of cologne will get distributed among the various capacity capacitors.

46:34
So I want to find out what are the various charges in the three capacitors?

46:39
And what are the potential difference?

46:41
So what are the potential difference between these two points?

46:43
What is the potential difference between these two terminals of the of the capacitor and so on.

46:48
So first I see is let me calculate this potential difference.

46:52
So 1 25 micro fyre has been supplied to this to this plate.

46:56
So this plate also has 1 25 micro.

46:58
So V one must be equal to Q by C one C one is the capacitance of this capacitor.

47:04
So I have the, the, the chart supplied by the battery is 1 25 micro colum which is supplied to this, these two plates and this 1 25 micro column generates a potential difference of Q by C one which is 1 25 10 to the minus six.

47:22
My capacitance was 25 micro which is equal to five words.

47:31
So if you have applied 10 volts across these two terminals, but out of this five volts gets dropped across these capacitance.

47:37
And then of course, the remaining five volts must be across these two because this difference is 10 volts.

47:44
So these two capacitors have a potential difference of five volts across their terminals.

47:49
So I can now calculate what is the charge on each of those?

47:59
What's A Q two, Q two is equal to C two into V.

48:05
So C two was five micro ferrets into five volts which is 25 micro chum and Q three is equal to C three to B which is 20 into 10 to minus six and five volts which is 100 micro.

48:31
So see what happens is now.

48:33
So I have, let me draw the, the diagram here.

48:35
So I have these two and I have these two here, these two plates.

48:43
So that is so if I connect, so I have 1 25 micro column here.

48:52
There is So this is C one, this was C two and this is C three.

48:57
So there is 25 micro column here and there's 100 micro colum.

49:04
So these 22 totally have 1.5 micro column which is actually the same as the charge contained in the upper capacitor.

49:11
So the battery has actually supplied 1 25 micro colum and out of which there's a potential drop of five volts here and there's a potential drop of five volts between the two remaining capacitors.

49:21
So you see that given a configuration of capacitors, I can use the law for adding capacitors connected in cities or in parallel and find equal in capacitor from there, I can calculate the potential difference across each capacitor, the charge contained in each capacitor and all that I need as far as the capacity values are concerned.

49:47
So this is a very nice way to resolve these problems in containing capacitors.

49:54
So you can actually try different kind of capacitance to and I will give you one problem here which you may like to analyze, consider a parallel paid capacitor.

50:20
A.

50:25
So you have to conducting plates separated by distance D.

50:33
So this is not a pastor.

50:35
Now, what I do, what I do is a solid metallic slab of thickness D by two is inert, is inserted between the do plates without touching them.

51:19
So just like this.

51:20
So I put a plate now this is conducting of width D by two.

51:29
The question is what is the capacitance before insertion and a the area plate of the plates is a, the next topic which I would like to discuss is I will briefly introduce now and then we will continue the discussion in the next class is energy stored in a capacity.

52:22
So as I mentioned to you, in the beginning, capacitors are used as devices which store electrostatic energy.

52:29
So when you charge a capacitor, you do work to create an electric field within the place of the cap between the plates of the capacitor, you move the charges around and charge the capacitor.

52:41
So once you charge the capacitor and disconnect the battery, you have stored some energy within the capacitor.

52:48
And that energy that you have stored can be released at any time later on when you, whenever you need.

52:55
So this is what happens in various applications.

52:58
For example, if you look at the flash that you use in a camera, there is a capacitor which gets first charged by from your battery.

53:07
And that capacitor once it gets charged suddenly releases the charge through the bulb of the flashlight, which then flashes and gives you an illumination for taking your photograph.

53:18
That's an example.

53:20
So similarly, you have a large number of examples where you need a certain release of electrostatic electrical current through a circuit.

53:27
And there you can use these capacitors.

53:29
First of all, you charge them and discharge them whenever you need.

53:34
So why, what I would like to do is to calculate what is the energy stored in a capacitor?

53:42
So the charging process develops a potential difference between two capacitors.

53:47
So, so let me assume some general capacitor like this.

53:49
So I have plus Q here and minus Q here.

53:54
And so you can see here there are electric field lines will be generated between these two caption plates, et cetera.

54:07
So I want to calculate what is the energy stored in the capacitor.

54:11
So what I will do with the next class is to start from this point, calculate what is the work done in moving charges electrons from the positive to the negative terminal and calculate the energy that is required to charge the capacitor from having no charges in the two capacitors to having plus Q and minus Q.

54:30
And we will calculate an energy and I will show you that that energy is also related to the energy contained in the electrostatic field between the two conductors.

54:42
OK.

54:42
So we will do this in the next class.

54:44
Thank you very much.
video_05:
0:43
Good morning to all of you.

0:46
We continue with our discussion on electrostatics.

0:49
In the last lecture, we had introduced concepts of electrostatic potential energy and electrostatic potential.

0:57
So let's recall if you have a collection of charges, then there is potential energy stored in the collection of charges.

1:05
So if you have all the charges of at infinitely separ separ distances and from there, if you bring one charge at a time and assemble the entire charge distribution, you need to do work on the charges to assemble them.

1:20
And this work that you do is actually stored in the form of potential energy of the entire charge distribution.

1:27
As I mentioned before, the energy is contained in the distribution of charges, it is not present in one charge or the other.

1:34
It is in the entire distribution of charges and it does not matter in what arrangement you bring the charges and assemble the entire distribution in whatever method you employ.

1:44
Finally, when you assemble a charge distribution, it has a certain amount of potential energy built into the system.

1:52
We then defined the potential electrostatic potential as the work done in bringing a unit positive charge from infinity to that point.

2:02
So if you if you have a positive charge point charge at infinity, you bring it from infinity to that point where you want to calculate the potential, the amount of work you do in bringing that charge defines the potential at that point.

2:15
And potential is a scalar quantity.

2:17
And as I mentioned last time, it is in many problems much easier to calculate potential and from potential as I will tell you electric fields can be calculated.

2:30
So as an example, what we did was last time was we calculated the potential of a point charge.

2:46
Suppose you have a point charge Q, the potential at any distance R from here is equal to Q by four by epsilon zero R.

2:59
So that's a scalar quantity.

3:00
And the potential of this point charge depends only on the distance of the point from the point charge.

3:06
And the potential follows the principle of superposition.

3:10
So if you have multiple charges, then the total potential at any point is the sum of the potentials created by each and every individual charge.

3:19
With this principle, we had calculated the potential of a dipole.

3:24
So if you have a minus Q and A plus Q charge here separated by distance to a, then this is a dipole with a dipole moment like this, then we calculated what is the potential at a distance are from here and a angle theta.

3:39
So theta is the angle made between the line joining the point where you are calculating the potential and the center of the dipole and the dipole axis.

3:49
And the potential at this point depends both on the position as well as the angle subtended by this line.

3:57
So I then we introduced the concept of equipotent surfaces.

4:03
These are surfaces where the potential electrostatic potentials remain constant.

4:08
So these could be surfaces of arbitrary shapes.

4:11
The shape depends on the kind of electric fields that you have.

4:14
If you have a uniform electric field, pointing in this direction, the equipotent surfaces are plain surfaces perpendicular to the electric field lines.

4:21
If you have a point charge, then we saw that the electric field the eco potentials are spheres.

4:27
So if you have a point charge here, Q then the eco potentials are spheres like this, these are all equal potential.

4:35
This is one eco potential, there is another eco potential.

4:37
They are all spheres surrounding the charge point charge and the point, the spheres have center at the point charges.

4:44
So and as you know, the electric field lines are like this away from the point charge.

4:49
If it is a positive charge, it is towards the point charge if it is a negative charge.

4:54
So these are the electric field lines.

4:57
So as I've drawn here, the electric field lines are perpendicular EENT surfaces.

5:02
We had discussed this again last time that if you have an eco potential surface, suppose I have some eco potential surface see it like this, this is an eco potential surface.

5:20
Then all it implies is the potential at every point on the on the surface is the same, I'm drawing a section of that surface on this plane here.

5:30
So there is a particular curve so there is a particular surface over which the potential remains constant.

5:35
So that means that to move a charge from this point to this point, I don't need to do any work.

5:40
In fact, I don't need to do any work in taking a unit positive charge from any point on that surface to any other point on the same surface because there are equal potentials.

5:50
The potential is the same all along the surface, which implies that there cannot be a component of the electric field which is along the eco potential surface.

5:59
So it implies that the electric field lines have to be perpendicular to the potential surfaces.

6:04
Here will be like this here will be like this.

6:06
So these are the electric electric field lines which are always perpendicular to the eco potentials.

6:11
This is all an example of a sphere that on a point charge that the eco potentials are spheres and the electric field lines are radial lines from the point charge.

6:23
So using this, what I want to do, which is which we started doing last time is to relate equi potentials and electric fields potential potential.

6:34
And electric fields.

6:35
Now, before that, I want to show you a picture of the eco potential surfaces of a dipole and the corresponding electric field lines, just like electric field lines, eco potentials are another way of representing the electric field distribution or potential distribution, which is helpful in understanding and in in in picturing the potentials and the electric field.

7:02
So what we'd like to do is to relate electric fields and potentials.

7:18
So we started to do this in the last lecture.

7:21
So again, let me recall, I want to relate a potential V to the electric field of the distribution.

7:27
So for this, what we do is we consider two eco potential lines equal potential surfaces, one with a potential V NOTT and another with a potential V NOTT plus DV, two potential equipotent surfaces which are close to each other in potentials.

7:44
One has a potential V not the other has V no plus DV.

7:48
Now, as I just mentioned, the electric field line will be perpendicular to the direction to the surface EENT surface.

7:55
So this may be the direction of the electric field here.

7:58
Now, what I do is I move from a point A on this eco potential to another point B on the nearby eco potential.

8:05
So when I move in this direction from this by eco potential to this e potential, I need to do some work.

8:12
So work done in moving a unit charge from A to B is equal to B, not plus DV minus B not which is equal to TB.

8:37
So you know that potential difference is the work done in moving a unit positive charge from one point to the other.

8:44
So when I have to move a point charge from A to B, the work done is potential at B minus potential at A.

8:50
So V naught plus DV minus V naught, which is DV.

8:53
So let me call this vector as DL.

8:57
So work is also equal to is also equal to minus E dot DL.

9:06
The force I need to apply is opposite of the direction direct field.

9:11
So the work done by the external agent is minus E dot DL which is equal to if this angle is theta, this is equal to minus E DL cost.

9:25
Now, if you see here, what is eco theta eco theta is the component of the electric field vector along the length direction A B?

9:32
This is the DL element electric vector points like this.

9:35
So eco theta is the component of the electric field along the direction in which I am moving.

9:41
So this can be written as minus el into DL where EL is the component of the electric field along the direction of motion.

9:50
So I have an equation that minus ELDL is equal to DV.

9:56
This implies EL is equal to minus DEL B by del.

10:06
So el is the elect component of the elect feet along the direction of in which I'm moving the charge.

10:12
So suppose for example, I consider a coordinate system here.

10:17
So let me say this is x axis, this is y axis, this is, these are the potentials here.

10:22
So if I move from suppose like let me move parallel to x axis.

10:27
So this is V nought some potential equal potential V NOTT V no plus DB.

10:32
So I move along the direction parallel to the X axis.

10:36
So my DL vector is actually DX vector.

10:41
So I'm moving along the X axis.

10:42
So the equation which I just know now wrote down DL vector is a long X axis.

10:48
So what I will get is the electric field ex will be equal to minus del B by de X.

10:57
So the, the partial derivative of V with respect to X is nothing but minus CX, I'm writing partial derivative because the potential depends on in general all three coordinates.

11:08
Xy and Z in a similar fashion.

11:12
If I move along the parallel to the Y axis, then I can get the following equation.

11:17
Ey is equal to minus del B by del by and similarly, Ez is equal to minus del B by Dez.

11:26
So these are three very important relations which relate the three components of the electric vector with the with the, with the X and Y and Z differentials.

11:37
So, in fact, from here, I can write E vector is equal to I ce X plus J ce Y plus K ce Z which is equal to minus of IC LV by DEL X plus JC del by DEL plus, that'll be better then.

12:05
So if I know the potential distribution of a given charge distribution, if I know V as a function of XY and Z I can calculate each of the three derivatives, partial derivatives and hence calculate the electric field as a functional position.

12:19
So this is a very powerful method and we started looking at an example.

12:24
So as an example, I want to look at calculation of metric field of a point charge point charge.

12:33
So I have a point charge Q here and I know that V of R is equal to.

12:39
So R is this distance Q by four by epsilon zero R.

12:46
So if I had a coordinated system here X YZ at this point, we had a coordinate XYZ, then R is the distance of this point from the, from the origin in which the point charge is sitting.

13:01
So R is equal to a square root of X square plus Y square plus Z square.

13:08
So V of XYZ is equal to two by four by epsilon zero square root of X square plus Y square plus Z square.

13:22
So now this is the potential as a function of XYZ.

13:26
So I can calculate the three electrical components.

13:29
So ex is equal to minus DEL B by DEL X which is equal to minus Q by four by epsilon zero in two, one by X square plus Y square plus Z square based three by two with a factor of minus half into two X.

13:50
So you must be able to differentiate this quantity which is one by R.

13:54
So one by three by two to the power of three by two of X capital Y capital Z square into minus half into two X, which is actually Q by four by epsilon 02.

14:08
I write this as X square plus Y square plus Z square into X by square root of X squared plus Y square plus Z square.

14:22
So what I've done is I've split the X square plus Y square plus Z square with three by two into X square plus Y square plus Z square and squared of X square plus Y square, Z square.

14:31
Now, what are these two quantities?

14:32
These are nothing but so I will get an expression for ex so ex is equal to Q by four by epsilon zero.

14:45
Now, what is this?

14:45
This is, as you can see here, this quantity is R square and this quantity is R.

14:50
So I get R square into X by R.

14:56
So that is the component along the X axis.

14:59
I will leave it to you as an exercise to show that ey will be equal to Q by 45 eps and zero R square into Y by R and Ez will be equal to Q by four pi epsilon zero R square into Z by R.

15:20
You look here, this equation for potential is symmetric in XY and Z.

15:24
So when you calculate differential with respect to Y, all you need to do is to replace X by Y and you will get expression for ey similarly expression for EZ so the electric field total electric field is nothing but I ce X plus J ce Y plus K ce Z which is nothing but thank you.

15:46
Bye.

15:47
Four pi epsilon zero R square and two I cap X plus J cap I plus K capital Z by R.

16:00
And now we can recognize this quantity.

16:02
This numerator in this, this numerator is nothing but are better.

16:08
XYZ are the coordinates of this point XYZ is the coordinator of this point.

16:14
And so our vector, this is our vector join the vector joining the point charge Q to the point P is nothing but R vector.

16:21
So I get the following expression for electric field of a point charge E is equal to Q by four by epsilon zero R square into R vector by R.

16:35
And what is our vector by R?

16:36
It is nothing but unit vector along the architecture.

16:39
Four pi epsilon zero R square into a cap.

16:42
And this is exactly the electric field that of a point charge from Kums Law.

16:49
So what I have shown you through the simple example that knowing the potential of a point charge, which is given by this, I can actually calculate the electric field of the point charge through this calculation.

17:02
And so this relationship which I've written here is a very, very useful relationship for very different charge distributions.

17:10
And so given any charge distribution, I can first calculate the potential distribution of the charge distribution.

17:17
Once I know V as a function of XY and Z I can use these three relationships to calculate Exey and EZ.

17:25
And from there, the total electric field e vector.

17:29
So this was a very simple example which I wanted to show you as an example, which can be used to calculate the electric field of a point charge.

17:40
Now I want to use the discussion that we are having to look at the following problem with conductors with cavities.

17:57
So let me start with the following situation.

17:59
I have some conductor arbi conductor.

18:04
So this is a conductor.

18:08
I put an excess charge queue on the conductor.

18:12
So what happens as we have discussed earlier that all this excess charge will sit on the surface of the conductor because you cannot have any electric wheel inside the conductor and the state static situation because if there is any charge inside the conductor in the presence of electric wheel, their charge will move and it will normally be a static situation.

18:34
So finally, when you are reached a static situation, that is there are no more changes.

18:41
The electric field inside the conductor must be zero.

18:44
And we use Gauss's law to show that this implies that there are no charges within the conductor, no excess charges within the conductor.

18:51
So all the excess charge that you have put on the conductor is on the outer surface on the surface of the conductor.

18:59
Now, I must mention here that the charge the distribution on the conductor is not uniform for an arbitrary shaped conductor.

19:07
The chargers will adjust themselves on the surface such that the electric field produced at any point within the conductor becomes zero.

19:16
So for example, the charge distribution here will be such that the electric field at this point which is created by various charges from all points here.

19:23
So they're all different directions.

19:26
So all this total electric field, the total sum of all the electric fields.

19:29
So if I if I take a conductor like this, and if I take a point here, this this charge here is producing electric field like this.

19:36
This charge from here is producing an electric field.

19:38
Like this, a charge from here is producing electric field like this.

19:40
A charge from here is producing the electric field like this.

19:43
This charge is producing an electric field like this, this charge is producing like this.

19:46
So I must add all the electric field contributions of all the charges present on the surface and I should find it zero here.

19:54
So the chargers adjust themselves on the surface in such a fashion that the net electric field within the conductor at every point within the conductor is actually zero.

20:05
Now, if you have a spherical conductor by symmetry, the entire charge sits uniformly distributed across the surface of the conductor.

20:12
So if you have a charge Q and if the radius is R, you get a surface charge density Q by four by R square, because then here in this situation, because of symmetry, the charge it distributes equally on the entire surface of the conductor.

20:28
So if you have seen this before, now, the question arises that suppose I have a cavity within this conductor, so cavity within in the conductor, so I have a conductor of arbitrary shape and I have a cavity.

20:54
So this is the conductor here and I have gravity.

20:58
And now I put a charge Q on the, on the conductor.

21:04
So the question is where are these charges now sitting, are they sitting on the outer surface only or are they sitting on the inner surface of the conductor or are they sitting on both the inner surface and the outer surface of the conductor?

21:18
So that's the problem we would like to see.

21:20
The first thing is that let me take as before we have done, I take a Gaussian surface which is completely lying within the conductor and encloses this cavity.

21:32
So this is the Gaussian surface, this is the Gaussian surface and closing the cavity.

21:41
And that Gaussian's surface lies entirely within the conductor.

21:46
Now because the electric field inside the conductor is zero, the net flux crossing this Gaussian surface must be zero because electric field at every point on the surface is zero.

21:57
So if I integrate E dot D A then I will get zero.

22:01
So that means that this Gaussian surface must be enclosing zero net charge.

22:08
Now, as I mentioned before, zero, net charge implies that there must be either no charge within the Gaussian surface or an equal amount of positive and negative charges.

22:20
Please remember zero net flux does not imply no charge.

22:24
It is possible that there may be no charge or there may be an equal amount of positive and negative charges.

22:30
If I have equal amount of positive and negative charges within the cavity, then the net flux crossing the surface of the Gaussian surface will still be zero.

22:38
So let me assume that this particular inner cavity surface also contains some charges.

22:45
So, but I must because the net flux through the Gaussian surface is zero, there must be equal amount of positive and negative charges within the on the surface.

22:54
So let me write, let me draw some charges here.

22:57
So I have plus plus plus plus charges here and maybe there are some negative charges on some other point on the surface.

23:03
So there are positive and negative charges sitting on the in the cavity.

23:07
So now what's gonna happen is remember there cannot be any electric field within the conductor.

23:14
So there must be electric field lines like this from the positive charge to the negative charge within the conductor cavity.

23:22
These electric field lines cannot enter the conductor because inside the conductor, the electric field must be zero.

23:30
Now let me take the following path.

23:34
So I take a point chart from here, move along this along this line and continue to move like this into the conductor and come back to this to this point, sorry to this point.

23:43
So I start from here, go along this and take a part and come back.

23:47
So I want to calculate integral E dot DL along this path.

23:54
Now remember we had discussed this before, electrostatic fields are conservative fields and integral error deal must be zero, which implies that if you have any energy field distribution, if you start from a point and come back to that same point, the network done in taking a, a charge from a point B to, to any circuit and coming back to the same point B the network done must be zero.

24:20
Now look at this path which I've taken.

24:23
So I move from here and then I move around this.

24:26
Now you see because the electric field on at all points on this path in this region of the path is zero, this integral has no contribution from this path.

24:36
Now, in this, in this path here there is an electric field and there is a finite length which I'm traveling.

24:41
So what I will find for this path, if I call this part C I will find that integral E dot DL along the part C is not equal to zero in this spot.

24:54
Now, this is inconsistent with the fact that integral deal must be zero.

24:59
And so what I conclude is there can be no no excess charge, excess charge within the on the surface on the inner surface.

25:22
So this inside cavity cavity, this inner surface of the cavity can cannot have any excess charge.

25:29
Because if it had charges, there must be equal amount of positive and negative charges which then will result in an electric field within the cavity of the conductor.

25:39
And then if I do this integral of RDL along a circuitous path which partly passes through the cavity and partly passes through the conductor, I will find that integral D is not equal to zero, which is inconsistent with the fact that integral D must be zero.

25:56
And hence, there cannot be any excess charge within the inner cavity of the conductor.

26:01
So if I have a conductor like this, any arbitrary conductor, if I have a cavity and if I put charges Q on the cavity on, on the conductor, all these charges must be sitting on the outer surface of the conductor, there cannot be any charge on the inner surface of the cavity.

26:19
All charges are sitting excess charge, all the excess charge which I put, I'm assuming positive excess charge here, all those charges are sitting on the outer surface of the cavity of the conductor.

26:30
And there are no charges within the conductor cavity.

26:33
So if you, if you touch any of these points, this is there's no charge at all on this inner surface of the cavity.

26:40
Now, if it so happens, let's suppose the conductor is a serial conductor and I have a cavity here, wherever I have a cavity, whatever charge if I put here, this charge will be equally distributed all across the surface of the spherical cavity, spherical conductor.

26:54
And there is no charge within the surface within the inner surface of this conductor which is the cavity surface, they don't charge there at all.

27:04
Now, I want to see what happens if I place a charge within the cavity of the conductor.

27:10
So I have now an example in which I have so let me take for example, a spherical conductor and let me have some cavity here.

27:20
So this is my conductor and I place a charge here, say plus Q.

27:30
Now I want to know what happens to the situation.

27:34
Now you see that there cannot be any electric field within the cavity within the conductor.

27:39
So what this plus plus two will do is to attract negative charges onto the surface.

27:45
So there will be an accumulation of negative charge on the surface of this cavity.

27:51
Now, if I assume the, the cavity to be a spherical cavity and this point charge to be placed at the center, then you can see from symmetry that this negative charge must be equally distributed across the cavity surface.

28:05
Because if you now take a Gaussian surface like this, which is lying within the conductor, the net flux must be zero.

28:14
And the next charge enclosed also must be zero.

28:16
So because you have put a plus two charge here, there must be a minus Q charge of accumulated charge on the inner surface of the conductor.

28:25
Now, this charge obviously are coming from the conductor and hence, they will leave an equal amount of positive charge on the outer surface of the conductor.

28:38
And if the conductor is a spherical conductor, that positive charge will get equally distributed all across the surface of the conductor.

28:49
So what I'm now seeing is if I did not have a charge within the cavity of the conductor, all the excess charge that you put on the conductor are all sitting on the outer surface without the cavity, if you have a cavity, and if you put a charge within the cavity, then this charge will attract.

29:07
If this charge is positive, it will attract an equal amount of negative charge onto the inner surface of the cavity.

29:13
Such that this Gaussian surface encloses zero net charge.

29:18
So if you have a plus Q charge here, there will be a minus Q charge accumulated on the inner surface of this cavity.

29:24
And so that the net flux will be zero on this Gaussian surface, the net charge enclosed by this Gaussian surface is zero.

29:31
And these negative charges will leave an equal amount of positive charge on the outer surface of the conductor.

29:37
And if this conductor is a spherical conductor, then this positive charge will be equally distributed on the outer surface.

29:44
And so these two charges together are not producing any electric field outside the conductor outside because that some of these two electric fields must be zero everywhere.

29:54
So from outside for the outside point, it looks as if there are positive charges on a spherical conductor.

30:00
And we know that the field here because of this positive charge on a spherical conductor is exactly the same as if the entire charge was concentrated at the center of the spherical conductor.

30:13
So look here that there is no information as to the existence of this cavity or the existence of the charge.

30:19
All that you see from outside is a conductor with equally charged distribution all across the surface of the conductor.

30:27
Now think what will happen if I move this charge from the center to a slide side point, if I move it here, what will happen to the electric field, what will happen to the charger distribution on the inner surface?

30:38
What will happen to the charge of distribution on the outer surface?

30:41
What will be the outside electric field distribution.

30:43
So I leave this problem to you.

30:45
Please give some thoughts to find out what will happen.

30:48
So I want to leave a problem here for you.

30:51
So a spherical conductor of radius R R zero and a spherical cavity of conductor artists and assume that I put a charge minus Q here.

31:11
So consider a spherical conductor with a spherical cavity centered in the conductor.

31:47
So this sphere and these two spheres are concentric.

31:50
So their centers meet and a charge minus Q is placed at the center of the cavity.

32:12
So calculate D surface charge density on the enough and outer surfaces and B calculate the electric field everywhere.

32:54
So from the discussion that we have had, so this is the conductor here and of an out the radius is R zero here and the spherical cavity has a radius rs both the spheres have the same center and at the center of the cavity, I've placed a charge minus Q.

33:10
So I want you to calculate the surface charge density on the inner surface and outer surface of the conductors and calculate direct field at every point in this problem.

33:24
Now, I want to take this discussion a little forward and look at the following problem.

33:30
So let me assume that I have a pair of spherical conductors.

33:36
So one conductor like this and another smaller conductor and joined by a conducting wire.

33:43
So this is it conducting where So this is radius A, this is radius B both are conductors and this is conducting.

34:10
And this is again, it is B now, what I'm going to do is I throw some excess charge on the system.

34:21
I throw a charge on the system.

34:23
So the charge will because these are conductors joined by another conductor here, the charge will distribute itself.

34:29
And let me assume the charge on this conductor is Q A and the charge on this conductor is QB please remember the two, the two spherical conductors are two different spherical conductors of different radii and the charge will distribute in such a fashion that you have some charge Q A on the sphere of radius A and a charge QB on the sphere of radius B.

34:50
Now we have discussed before that conductors form an eco potential eco potential.

34:55
So the potential at both the sphere and the sphere and the wire must all be the same because if there was a potential difference, then that will lead to an electric field and that electric field will ensure the charges then move and until the potential becomes equal all along the conductor.

35:12
So the this conductor as well as this conductor will have the same potential.

35:18
Now, I want to approximate we have calculated the potential of a spherical conductor.

35:24
And so the with the charge Q A so potential on the surface of this conductor B A is Q A B 45 epsilon zero into R A, remember the potential of a spherical charge distribution.

35:40
So if I have a sphere and if I would charge Q on this conducting sphere.

35:49
And so as far as outside region is concerned, this sphere charge sphere acts like a point charge at this point.

35:55
So the potential at any point R from here is Q by 457 and zero R.

36:02
And on the surface at R is equal to R which is the surface of the conductor potential at R is equal to Q by 45 S 70 R.

36:14
So the potential on the surface of the conductor is equal to the charge carried by the conductor divided by 45 S 70 times ra of the conductor.

36:23
So that is the question which I'm using here.

36:26
So what I'm saying is as an approximation, I'm assuming that the potential of this spherical charge and this spherical conductor are, are the same in approximately equal to VA is equal to Q A by 4570 R A sorry A, the radius of the sphere and VB is equal to the charge on that conductor divided by 45 eps and zero into B B is the ras of that conductor A is the radius of this conductor.

36:56
And I know that B A is equal to BB because both conductors are at the same potential.

37:03
This implies that Q A by A is equal to QB by B OK.

37:16
So now suppose Sigma A and Sigma B are the charged densities.

37:20
So if this charge surface charge densities, sigma A and sigma B.

37:34
So here it is sigma A and here it is Sigma B, then Q A must be equal to sigma A into four pi A square and QB must be equal to sigma B into four pi B squared.

37:59
So I had this equation, I had this relationship Q A by A is equal QB by B which means that Sigma A into four by a square by A is equal to Sigma B into four pi B square by B.

38:17
So I get Sigma A into A S equal to Sigma B to B.

38:28
So I also know the electric field at the surface of these conductors.

38:34
If you have a surface charge density Sigma electric field is equal to Sigma by epsilon zero.

38:44
So the for a surface charge density Sigma, the electric field is sigma by epsilon zero.

38:53
So what I get is electric field on the surface of this conductor radius A is sigma A by epsilon zero.

39:02
And electric field on the surface of the conductor B is sigma B by epsilon zero.

39:08
So and I have the sigma A A is called sigma BB.

39:12
So it implies that E A times A equal to GB times B.

39:19
So EB by E A is equal to A by B.

39:30
So the two electric fields are related to this.

39:32
So let me read out the figure here you have one sphere of radius A connected to another sphere of radius B.

39:41
So all it implies is the electric field at this point on the surface of this is E A and the here is EB, so the ratio of these two electric fields is so EB by E is A by B.

39:57
So you see that a smaller sphere, which means A B is less than A EB is much bigger than E.

40:05
So the smaller the sphere, the stronger the electric field.

40:08
So what happens is if you have two spheres, if you have two spheres joined like this, the two spheres are form an eco potential and the electric field just surrounding the smaller sphere will be much, much higher than that surrounding the larger sphere.

40:26
So actually I can generalize this and to say that if you have a conductor which, which is not spherical, but it has some sharp edges like this, then the charges will distribute in such a fashion that this is a smaller radius here compared to this radius here.

40:42
So here the sigma will be suppose I call the sigma one here and sigma two here, the sigma two will be much bigger than my month.

40:54
And so the electric field at this point will be much stronger.

40:57
So in fact, I can draw electric field lines like this.

41:00
So suppose I have a conductor like this.

41:04
And if I put positive charges, so there will be some positive charges and there will there will be more positive charge accumulated here.

41:10
So the positive charge then still will increase.

41:12
So the electric field lines here, there will be some electric field lines like this.

41:23
The electric field lines will be much stronger here, they are closer electric field lines than here.

41:28
So the electric field lines will cut around the corner point of the conductor.

41:32
So this is a very, very important aspect in a spherical conductor.

41:36
There are all the points have the same radiator curvature.

41:39
So the charge is distributed equally along the surface of the conductor.

41:43
But here, if you have sharp edges on the conductor, then you have extremely large charge density generated there.

41:49
And as we have seen before, this electric field at this point, if it exceeds the breakdown of air, then you will have a spark creator at that point.

41:59
In fact, this is a very interesting concept and this is this concept is used in where you must have seen lightning rods that are used to pick up the lightning.

42:12
So you have sharp edges, a conductor with a sharp edge on the top of the residence and this conductor is joined by conducting wire to the ground.

42:22
So when you have clouds with charged clouds which are on top of this region here, then the very strong electric field is generated between the cloud and the ground and the electric field lines crowd towards the tip of the conductor here.

42:36
And so the charge which gets discharged from the clouds comes and goes through this conductor to the ground and thus protects the other instruments or houses from getting shock.

42:47
So this is a very interesting application of this fact that electric field lines crowd along the corner of around, around sharp edges.

42:57
In fact, sharp edges have to be avoided if you want to avoid any strong electric fields in the in the in your problem.

43:08
OK.

43:08
So now having seen this conductors, a potential surfaces charges put on conductors reside on the outer surface of the conductor.

43:18
Now I would like to bring in another concept which is the concept of capacitors and capacitance if you have any two conductors getting equal and opposite charges.

43:51
So what I do is I have two conductors, I move, I move some electrons from one conductor to the other conductor.

43:57
So I will leave some positive charge.

43:59
So I move some electrons from this conductor to this conductor.

44:02
So I will leave a positive net net positive charge on this conductor.

44:05
This conductor will have ne negative charge.

44:08
So I have two conductors which are oppositely charged and kept this particular configuration forms what is called as a capacitor.

44:19
So you can see that lines will be generated between these because of these charges, the electric wheel lines will be generated And so this particular configuration forms what is called as a capacitor.

44:33
So if you have two conductors which have one conductor has a positive charge and the other conductor has an equal negative charge, this pair of conductors forms what is called as a capacitor.

44:43
And these capacitors are usually drawn by a symbol like this.

44:49
This is essentially the conductor which you will discuss which in terms of parallel bit capacitor.

44:54
So let us look at the simplest of these capacitors, which is the parallel pa capacitor.

45:11
So I have here I have two capas, two conductors.

45:19
So this is this is actually two plates like this.

45:21
There are one plate here, another plate here and separated by distance D.

45:28
Let me put positive charge on one and an equal negative charge on the other.

45:41
So this process of putting charges on these conductors is called charging of the conductors charging of the capacitance.

45:57
So if I connect these two pairs of conductors to a battery, I will be able to transfer electrons from one conductor to the other conductor.

46:04
And in that process, I charge these two and I disconnect the battery.

46:08
And what I will have is two conductors like this two parallel plates facing each other with one with a positive charge, the other with a negative charge.

46:16
Now this forms what is called the parallel plate capacitor.

46:18
These are two plates which are facing each other and forming what is called a capacitor.

46:23
So capacitor is a device where you can store charges and you can store energy.

46:28
We will calculate that this particular configuration stores energy in the form of electrostatic energy and which can be used later on for very many, many applications.

46:38
Now, as we have been discussing these two conductors form eco potential surfaces.

46:43
So the negative charge here the the positive charge on the surface here attracts the negative charge.

46:49
And these two, the inner surfaces of these two conductors get charged with positive charge here and negative charge here.

46:55
So let me assume the surface charge density of sigma and minus sigma.

47:01
So we've discussed this problem before that if you have a charge density sigma, then it creates an electric field.

47:08
So electric field produced by this surface charge density in this direction here is sigma by two eps and zero in everywhere on the side.

47:16
And it is on this side, the sigma by 270.

47:21
This negative charge distribution creates sigma by two epsilon zero here and here it creates sigma by two F 70 here.

47:29
So we have discussed this problem before and we have shown that between the two surfaces of these conductors, we have a net electric field given bike.

47:38
So I have this conductor here another conductor here.

47:43
So I'm assuming in this calculation that these plates are much bigger compared to the spacing.

47:49
The area of the plates is large, very large compared to the size of the plate is very large compared to the distance separating them.

47:55
So I have positive charges here and I have negative charges on this side.

48:06
And I have an electric field in between which is equal to sigma by eps.

48:11
And there are three lines are coming like this.

48:16
If the plates are very large in size, the linear dimension of the plate is large compared to the separation, then I can neglect what I call as end effects.

48:26
That means at towards the end of these, of these conductors, the charges will not be uniformly distributed because of end effects.

48:33
But I'm neglecting the end effects.

48:34
And I know that towards the center of the parallel pits system, I will have uniform electric field.

48:41
Now I want to calculate the relationship between the charges which are contained in these two plates and the potential difference between these two.

48:51
So what is the potential difference between these two?

48:53
So potential difference?

48:55
So potential difference V is equal to the work done in moving a, a charge from one place to the other.

49:11
And that must be electric field times the distance which is equal to sigma D by eps and zero sigma by epsilon zero is the electric field D is the distance between the two conductors.

49:23
So to move a distance D so these electric field lines are vertical lines here.

49:28
So to move a charge from one plate to the other plate, I need to do a work.

49:32
The electric field times the distance separating them and Sigma D by epsilon zero.

49:36
And Sigma is equal to the charge on the capacitor plates divided by the area of the plates A.

49:42
So I'm assuming plate area A and plate separation D so Sigma is Q by A so I get V is equal to Q times D by epsilon zero A.

50:08
So what we see is the potential difference between these two conductors is proportional to the charge carried by the conductors.

50:16
Now this is for this parallel page, I have shown you but one can show that in general if you have two conductors which have plus Q and minus Q charges, then the potential difference between these two conductors is proportional to the charge carried by the conductors.

50:34
So we can define a quantity here.

50:37
This, this is a constant here which we, we define and we define what is called the capacitance C.

50:47
So we had this equation V is equal to Q into D by epsilon zero A.

50:53
So if we define C is equal to XL and zero A by D, so B is equal to by C, so that's a relationship.

51:06
So this one by C is the proportionality constant which is relates V and Q and this is called the capacitance.

51:17
So as I mentioned, capacitance is a, is a quantity which relates the potential difference between two conductors which are carrying a charge queue So, and I have, I have, although I have derived this relationship for a parallel pa system, this relationship is true in general.

51:37
That means if you have two arbitrarily shaped conductors carrying a charge Q plus Q and minus Q, they will develop a potential difference.

51:44
V.

51:45
And the potential difference V between these two conductors will be proportional to the charge carried by the conductors.

51:50
And that proportionality constant is actually the capacitance of the conductor.

51:54
So we have V is equal Q by C or Q is equal to C times V.

52:00
And this capacitance is a quantity which is a geometrical quantity.

52:05
It only depends on the geometrical parameters such as the area of the conductors, the distance between the conductors et cetera.

52:21
It is not dependent on the charges or potential that you are calculating.

52:25
So we see the proposal be constant.

52:28
Now, in this, we have calculated C as epsilon zero A by D that is an approximate relationship for a parallel capacitor because we have effectively in this calculation neglected the effects of NS.

52:41
But this is a reasonably good approximation.

52:43
If you want to, if you were to calculate more precisely, you will get a slightly different value of C compared to this number.

52:50
But otherwise, this relationship will be still valid.

52:53
B is equal by C where C is the capacitance of this, of this conductor pair.

52:59
So let me calculate.

53:00
let me take an example.

53:07
So let me take a past two plates.

53:15
Let me assume the separation is one millimeter.

53:20
So D is equal to one millimeter.

53:23
And let me assume an area of 10 centimeters square.

53:30
So capacitance of this epsilon zero A by D which is equal to 8.85 10 to the minus 12 and 2, 10 centimeters square is 10, 10 to the minus 4 m square divided by 10 to the minus 3 m, which is approximately which is equal to 8.85 Pifer.

53:59
It's actually 8.85 and 2, 10 to the minus 12.

54:05
So far is a unit of capacitance.

54:11
This is named after Michael Faraday and it is given by the, the, if you take in volts, if you look at this equation here, if you take V in volts and Q in Kums C comes out to be a unit called ferrets.

54:29
And so this amount of capacitance of this parallel bit capacitor with two plates separated by one millimeter separation and each can, each having an area of 10 centimeter square is 8.85 of ferrets.

54:43
So Ferra is a unit of capacitance and this particular fro is a very, very large quantity.

54:49
So as you can see here, this this surface battle capacitor has any capacitance of 8.85 PF So suppose I were to take this parallel bit capacitor.

55:01
And so I, I take the same parallel bit capacitor.

55:06
And if I, so the capacitance is 8.85 10 to the minus 12 ferrets.

55:14
And if I, if I apply a potential difference B is equal one volt and the corresponding charge will be C times V which is equal to eight point 5 to 10 to minus 12 ferrets into one bolt, which is equal to eight point 85 10 to the minus 12, which is equal to 8.85.

55:49
That is the charge carried by the conductors.

55:51
So what we will do is in today, we will stop, stop at this point.

55:56
And in the next lecture, we will calculate capacitance of other configurations like cylindrical capacitors and spherical capacitors.

56:04
And we will see in every case that the potential difference and the charge carried by the capacitors are related to each other.

56:10
And the proportionality constant gives me the capacitance of the of the pair and capacitors are very, very important components in electronic circuits.

56:18
And we will understand a little bit more about capacitance later in later lectures.

56:24
Thank you very much.
video_06:
0:40
Good morning to all of you.

0:43
We will continue with our discussion on electrostatics.

0:47
In the last lecture, we had started to discuss electrostatic potential and potential energy.

0:56
So we started to discuss electrostatic potential energy and electrostatic potential electricity, potential energy is the work done by an external agent to move a charge from one point to another point.

1:31
So we had derived that the potential energy of a pair of particles of a pair of point charges Q and Q SVU is equal to QQ by four by epsilon zero R where there a charge B capital Q small charge Q and this distances are so that defines the potential energy of a pair of point charges.

2:15
If you have multiple point charges, for example, potential energy of a system of, of charges, you will be equal to.

2:36
So if you have three charges, Q one Q two by 45 eps and zero R 12 plus Q one Q three Y four by epsilon zero R 13 plus Q two, Q three, Y 45 S and zero or 23.

2:58
So essentially you have one charge Q one here, another charge Q two say another charge Q three.

3:05
So the potential energy is essentially defined by the separation between this, this is R 12, this is R 13 and this is R 23.

3:18
So we have the potential energy for a system of charges.

3:22
And I must mention, as I mentioned last time that this potential energy is independent of the sequence in which you are assembling the charges.

3:33
So it does not matter whether you bring Q one first and then Q two and Q three or you bring Q two first and then Q one and Q three, it's independent of the sequence of assembling of the charger distribution.

3:46
And also remember that this is an energy that is contained in the complete system of charges.

3:55
We then defined the electrostatic potential as the work done in bringing a unit charge from infinity to that point.

4:12
So for example, the potential for a point charge Q will be V of R is equal to Q by 45 S seven and zero R where Q is some charge here and R is the distance from here from the charge.

4:38
And that is the potential at this point.

4:40
The point and distance are from the point charge.

4:43
That is the actually the work done in bringing a unit charge from infinity to this point here.

4:50
And remember that V of R is a scalar quantity.

5:04
We will show you, I will show you later on that VFR and the electric field corresponding electric field are related.

5:18
But I must try the vector here the potential at any point and the electric field at that point are related to each other.

5:28
Sometimes it is easy to calculate the potential and from the potential to calculate the electric field.

5:35
And we will see some examples.

5:36
A little later, I also introduced a unit of potential.

5:46
It's volt.

5:47
So one volt is equal to one Joel Park.

5:56
That is the work down on energy in moving one charge from infinity to that point.

6:02
At this point.

6:03
I might like to mention that there is a unit of energy which is used in many places called the electron board abbreviated as EV So one electron volt is equal to the charge of one electron into one volt, which is 1.6 10 to the minus 19 jewel.

6:34
So that's a unit of energy.

6:36
It's, it's the energy required bring to move a charge of one electron across a potential difference of one bolt.

6:46
I I also can relate the work done.

6:53
Bye an external force in moving unit charge from a point, right?

7:18
Two RF yes, W is equal to V at RF minus V at R.

7:28
So for a point charge W will be equal to Q by 45 epsilon 01 by RF minus one by R I.

7:49
So the work done in moving a charge from one point to another point depends on the potential difference between these two points.

7:56
And that is a typical relationship which tells you the work done for moving a unit charge is the difference of potentials between these two points potentials follow a superposition principle.

8:19
So if you have a number of charges, Q one, Q two, Q three, et cetera, and if you had a point here, so if I call this distance R one, this distance are two, this distance are three.

8:35
So the total potential at this point at a point B is actually equal to Q one bye 45 S 70 R one plus Q 254570 R two plus 23 by four by epsilon zero R three.

8:55
So in general, this is actually Q I Y 45 epsilon zero R A.

9:06
And if you have a distribution of charges, so if I have a volume with some distribution of charges, I can take a infinite ASIM volume here with a charge ad and I want to calculate the potential at this point are at a distance are from the origin.

9:35
This is the origin.

9:37
And if I call this R prime V at R is actually one by four by epsilon zero integral DQ by R prime.

9:48
So our prime is the distance of this point from the elementary charge GQ.

9:51
And I integrate over the entire volume or the surface or the line to get the total potential at that point.

9:58
So we can use the superposition principle to obtain the total potential at any point in the presence of multiple charges.

10:07
So now I want to discuss some examples to show you how I can calculate the potential.

10:13
So first, let's start with the first example potential of a charged conducting sphere.

10:37
So I have a, a sphere which is a conducting sphere and it has an excess excess charge Q put on it, let R be the radius of the conductor.

10:51
So we have actually shown before that the electric field produced by a conducting sphere, charge conducting sphere is the same as the, as if the entire charge was situated on the at the center of the sphere.

11:06
As far as outside regions are concerned inside the conductor, the electric field is zero.

11:11
So actually we can get the electric field here as Q by four by epsilon zero R square into R cap.

11:20
This is for R greater than R which is equal to 04 R less than R no electric field inside the conductor and electric field of QR K by 4570 R square.

11:33
So are the distance of any point from here.

11:37
So I can calculate the potential at this point.

11:40
VR is equal to integral infinity to R F external dot Dr which is equal to minus too bye 45 eps and zero integral Dr by R square infinity to R which is actually equal to Q by fourth way abstain and zero I, this is for R greater than R because the electric field which I'm using here in this integration is the electric field for a point lying outside the sphere.

12:18
So that is the potential as far as outside points are concerned.

12:22
And the potential is exactly the same as if the entire charge was concentrated at the center.

12:29
So I can calculate what is the potential at the surface of the sphere which is equal to Q by four by epsilon zero R.

12:37
This is at R is equal to R.

12:41
So the potential keeps on changing until I reach the surface of the conductor.

12:46
And this the variation is given by Q by 4570 R.

12:50
Now inside the conductor, there is no electric field.

12:54
So I don't have to do any work in moving a charge inside the conductor from the surface to any other point inside the conductor, which means that the potential inside the conductor must be the same as at the surface of the conductor.

13:09
Remember potential is related to the work done in moving a charge.

13:12
So because there is no electric bill within the conductor, I don't have to do any work in moving the charge anywhere within the conductor, which means that the potential inside the conductor must be the same as this.

13:24
So what I see is first of all, the entire conductor is at the same potential.

13:30
So conductor forms an equal potential surface, it's a surface where the potential remains constant.

13:35
And so if I were to draw the potential is a function of position.

13:40
So if this is my sphere carrying a charge, so let me try to draw a figure here which shows B as a function of R.

13:48
So this is the radius as a position as a functional position.

13:54
If I plot, you see that as I come, suppose the charge is positive as I come closer, you look at the potential distribution here one by R.

14:03
So as I come closer to the sphere, small R in decreases and so the potential increases.

14:09
So the potential increase is one by R from on here and here then inside the conductor, there is no change in potential.

14:17
So as I move away from the sphere, the potential drops as one by R and inside the conductor, the potential remains constant.

14:24
So this is actually Q by four by epsilon zero R.

14:30
So inside the conductor's potential is constant, but I already have calculated before the electric field is a functional position.

14:37
Electric field.

14:38
So let me look at the same boundary here, you know that electric field goes as one by R square.

14:44
Here, here the electric field goes as one by R square.

14:47
So it goes faster than one by R but and it's so it, it rises faster like this and then the electric field becomes zero inside the conductor.

14:57
And then again, it drops fast.

15:00
So you can see the electric field decreases faster as a function of R inside the conductor, the electric field is zero inside the conductor.

15:07
The potential remains constant.

15:09
So please note here that I can have regions where the electric field is zero, but the potential is not zero, the potential will remain constant in that region.

15:20
So a conductor is an eco potent surface.

15:22
So let me calculate some numbers here.

15:24
Let me put some actual values and calculate.

15:27
So let me take a sphere of radius R is equal to 10 centimeter just 0.1 m.

15:41
So this is the contact link sphere.

15:47
OK.

15:47
Let me assume that we have a charge of one nano colum 10 to the minus nine K placed on the sphere.

15:56
So what is the potential on the sphere which is by four pi epsilon zero R which is equal to 10 to the minus nine into one by four pi epsilon zero is 9 10 to the 19 divided by 0.1 which is equal to 90 volts.

16:19
So if you take a sphere of radius, 0.1 m and put a charge of one nano colum on the sphere, this sphere gets a potential of 90 volts.

16:30
It essentially means that you need to spend energy to bring a charge from infinity to this point if the if the charge is positive.

16:38
So what is the electric field, electric field on the surface is actually as you can see here, electric field varies as one by R square potential varies as one by R.

16:47
So the electric field on the sphere surface of the sphere must be Q by four fives and then zero R square and radially directed.

16:54
So this is equal to V by R which is equal to 90 by 0.1 which is equal to 900 volts per meter.

17:06
So on the surface of the electric field, on the surface of this spherical conductor, you have an electric field which is pointing like this of 900 volts per meter.

17:15
It's pointing like this here, pointing like if the the surface charges, if the charge is positive positive Q charges, positive electric field is pointing away and the inside, inside the conductor, the potential remains constant.

17:29
Now, I must mention here a certain aspect that happens in, in nature and that is if you have, if you look at electric fields in air, if the electric field becomes stronger and stronger, the electric field can knock off electrons from the atoms.

17:45
And so it creates a breakdown.

17:47
You you can see a spark taking place in air.

17:50
And the, the at the typical conditions, the maximum energy field in air so that there is no breakdown emacs is equal to 3 to 20 per six volts per meter.

18:18
3 million volts per meter is the maximum electric field you can have if you try to generate an electric field beyond this point, then the there will be a breakdown and the, the electric field will be so high that you'll see a spark coming out of that conductor.

18:33
So you can see here that if you take a radius of 0.1 m, the maximum potential of this conducting sphere.

18:51
V max is equal to emacs into the radius of the sphere which is 3 20 past six into 0.1 which is equal to t into 10 to the power of five fourth which is written as 300 kilowatts.

19:18
If you decrease the radius to R is equal to one centimeter which is 0.01 m.

19:28
V max reduces by a factor of 10 and you get 30 kilowatts.

19:36
So you cannot have a, a conducting sphere of radius of one centimeter and raise it to a potential greater than 30 kilowatts.

19:45
Because if you try to increase the potential by charging more, the electric field becomes so intense that there will be a spark in air and the charges will get out from this from the spherical conductor.

19:55
So there is an upper limit to how much of charge you can put on the conductor you can from here calculate for this radius.

20:02
What is the maximum charge that you can put on the spherical conductor?

20:09
I would like to discuss another important example and that is potential due to a dipole.

20:28
Remember in an earlier class, we had discussed the electric field produced by diol, we had calculated the electric field along the axis and on the equatorial plane.

20:38
And right now, I want to calculate what is the potential of a typo.

20:44
So let me draw the dipole here.

20:46
So this is minus Q, this is plus Q.

20:51
Remember the dipole moment is from minus Q to plus Q.

20:55
So I want to calculate the potential at this point.

20:58
So let me just let this point be the center of the dipole.

21:01
This distance, let me call R, let me call this distance R one.

21:05
Let me call this distance R two.

21:07
And this is the point B, this distances are from the center O to this point pr this distance from minus Q to P is R two from plus Q to P is R one.

21:20
So remember potential satisfies superposition principle.

21:25
So V at P must be equal to potential at P due to plus Q charge plus potential at P due to minus Q charge.

21:35
Now, because the distance is R one, the plus Q charge produces a potential +45 eps and zero R one and minus Q produces minus Q by four pi epsilon zero R two.

21:49
So this is actually two by four by eps and 01 by R one minus one by R two.

21:59
Now let me call this angle theta.

22:03
Now you have all done geometry and calculated the relationship between the various lengths of a triangle.

22:10
So let me write up the equation here, R one square is actually equal to R square plus.

22:16
So this distance was two A, remember we had marked a dipole as two equal and negative equal and opposite charges separated by distance.

22:24
So two A is the separation between the two charges.

22:27
So R square plus a square minus two A R theta and R two square is equal to R square plus a square plus two A R Caustic.

22:45
So actually substituting this R one and R two in this equation, I can calculate the potential at any value any point if I know the distance of that point from the center.

22:55
And if I know the angle made by that line joining the center of the dipole to the point with the diol axis, so this formula can be used to calculate potential at any point.

23:05
And please remember potential is a scalar quantity.

23:08
So I'm just adding the the quantity is potential because of plus Q plus potential because of minus Q.

23:16
Now we are also introduced a point dipole where the dipole size is very small compared to distances.

23:21
So let me try to calculate an approximate expression for the potential when the distance R becomes very large compared to the size of a dipole.

23:30
So if R is much greater than A, I can make a, an expansion of this and obtain approximate expressions for R and R two.

23:38
So if you look at R one square let me write down rin square again.

23:41
So R, one square is equal to R square plus a square minus two A R of theta which is equal to R square into one plus a square by R square minus two R two A by R cost.

24:01
So R one is approximately equal to R and 21 plus A squared by R square minus two A by R cost theta this for half square root.

24:15
So one by R one is approximately equal to one by R into one plus A squared by R square minus two A by R cost.

24:25
The Facebook minus half I've just inverted.

24:30
Now, if R is much, much greater than A, then I can approximate.

24:38
Actually, these are, these are exact solution.

24:40
They are not, they're not approximate, they are exact.

24:41
Now I approximate.

24:42
So one by R and two you know the binomial expansion here.

24:47
So I get one plus A by R two cost the approximately.

24:54
So I'm neglected, I'm neglected terms of order A squared by R square and greater.

25:12
So A squared by R square A Q by R cube, et cetera.

25:14
All these things have been neglected and writing this approximation.

25:18
So one by R, one is approximately one by R to one plus A by R cost.

25:22
Theta.

25:22
Similarly, I can make an approximation for R two square.

25:25
So R two square was equal to R square plus a square plus two A R cost.

25:32
The So I leave the exercise to you.

25:35
So you can show that one by R two is approximately one by R and one minus A by R cost.

25:46
So one by R, one minus one by R two is approximately equal to two A yr cost.

25:57
So one by one was one by R plus A by R squared plus the A R square and one by R two was one by R minus A by R square cost.

26:09
So when I subtract one by R two from one by R one, you I get this.

26:13
So I get a potential V at B is equal to by 45 eps and zero into two A by R square.

26:22
And into the, remember we had defined the dipole moment magnitude of dipple moment as Q times two A.

26:32
So V of P is equal to P magnitude cost theta bye four by epsilon zero.

26:42
Ask her.

26:44
Now let me look at the figure here.

26:46
So remember here.

26:48
So this is the figure.

26:48
Let me draw here again.

26:50
So I had the dipole like this.

26:52
So this was P vector and theta is this vector this angle.

26:58
So at this point, I'm calculating the potential.

27:02
So this is R cap and this is P vector and this is the, so what is B cost cost is nothing but P dot A cap.

27:16
So this is equal to B dot R by 4570.

27:26
So let me write again here.

27:28
So if I had a, if I had a like this B and if I take a point P at a distance R from the dipole and this, if this angle is theta, then B at R is equal to Q by four by epsilon zero, sorry P dot R cap by 4570 R.

27:52
And this is valid for are much, much greater than A, which is what we have assumed in writing in deriving this equation.

28:01
So two things you notice that unlike a point charge where the potential varied as one by R for a dipole, the potential varies as one by R square.

28:14
Remember we have seen the same thing in the electric field case, the electric field of a point charge varies at one by R square.

28:20
While the electric field of a dipole varied at one by R cube.

28:23
So the potential is decreasing as one by R square from the dipole.

28:28
And also it depends on the angle theta.

28:30
So as you change theta and keep the distance of the point B constant, if I move along the, along the point with R, the constant, then theta changes R remains constant, but P dot R will change.

28:42
And so the potential will change.

28:44
So the potential not only depends on the distance of the point from the dipole, but also the angle made by this line with the dipole axis.

28:53
So for example, so if I write in terms of theta, this is equal to P cause theta by 45 and zero R square.

29:05
So if you take the is equal to zero V of R along this line, theta equal to zero is P by 455 and zero R square.

29:15
Theta is equal to zero is, this is P, this line this is the zero and for the is equal to pi vor minus P by and so this is, please remember this is minus Q.

29:39
This is plus Q.

29:41
The dial moment is a vector from minus Q to plus Q.

29:46
So the type of moment is pointing like this.

29:48
And so the potential on this side is positive, the potential on this side is negative and for theta is equal to five by two B of R is equal to 05 by two is this line.

30:02
So along the equatorial plane, the potential is zero.

30:05
you can immediately understand this because this point, any point on the equal to a plane is equally distant from the plus charge and the minus charge.

30:15
And because the potential is the sum of potential produced by plus charge and the potential produced by minus charge and the charges have equal magnitudes, the total potential on the axis is zero.

30:27
So the potential of a dipole goes as one by R square.

30:29
And the potential also depends on the angle between the, the P vector and the position where you are calculating the.

30:40
So just for a summary, let me look at a third example and that is I want to calculate potential often in finite lenient charge bey.

31:15
So I have a line charge here.

31:18
So lambda is the line charge charge per unit length.

31:21
And I want to calculate the potential at some point here.

31:24
OK.

31:25
So this distance is R now remember we had calculated the electric field of a infinite line charge.

31:35
During me recall to calculate the electric field, I take a Gaussian surface which is a cylinder of and of radius R.

31:49
The electric field by three symmetry arguments.

31:51
We said the electric field must be pointing away from the line charge.

31:54
So the electric field must be in this direction here in this direction here if the line charge is positive.

31:59
And so we calculated the total flux total flux was two pi R into L if the length of this is L into electric field must be equal to the charge contained by epsilon zero.

32:14
So we get electric field as lambda by two by epsilon zero R.

32:19
This we have already seen an electric field vector is a cap where a cap in this direction, no, the odd gap is a vector along a direction we just along the line perpendicular to the drawn perpendicular, the line charge.

32:35
So at this point, the a a cap will be like this at this point.

32:39
The AR cap will be like this.

32:41
So that is an electric field.

32:42
So I can actually calculate the work done in bringing a charge from some point R A to RB.

32:48
So let me take a point here.

32:50
So this is a point at distance R A, this is a point A RB.

32:57
So this instance is RB.

33:00
So I want to calculate what is the work done?

33:03
So work done is equal to minus R A to RB lambda by two pi epsilon zero R A cap into dot product with a CD R.

33:19
So which is equal to minus lambda by two by epsilon zero R A to RB Dr by R which is equal to lambda by two pipes is zero log of R A.

33:43
We are integral of one by RDDR is actually log and I have taken care of a sign by reversing the the, the inside the log.

33:56
So the work done in bringing a charge from R eight RB is essentially lamb up by 2570 R eight by RB log.

34:04
Now you already see a problem here and the problem is that if you're reference point happens to be infinity, which means if I take R A to be infinity.

34:14
So this is work done in bringing a charge from R A to RB.

34:18
So if I start from infinity, I say I see there is an infinity within the log and there's a problem and that problem is appearing because the line charge density itself is extending over infinite length.

34:30
So in such situations and problems in which the charge distributions extends to infinity, which is of course not practical because usually in practice, all charge distributions are finite.

34:41
But in mathematics, we tend to use certain distributions in which the charge density is extending over infinity.

34:48
For example, in finite line charge or infinite plane sheet, etcetera.

34:52
And these are useful to calculate electric fields and potentials.

34:57
But in such situations, you will find an infinity of potential at in, at infinite distances from the charge distribution.

35:04
So in these cases, what we do is we change the reference point and we say that instead of using reference point to be infinity, we will say that we will, we will use the zero potential at some, at some R value.

35:27
So if I say so let B is equal to zero at R is equal to R A is equal to capital R and we let the final point to be R.

35:42
So we will get V of R is equal to lambda by two pipes is and zero log capital are by smaller because potential is a in a relative quantity.

35:58
It's like in gravitation potential, a potential at a certain height is measured with a potential zero potential on the earth surface.

36:05
So you can measure the potential differences between points.

36:08
They will not depend on the origin of the reference.

36:11
So here what we have done is because the potential tends to infinity at infinity, we have restricted and said that we will choose the zero of potential to be at a finite distance from the line charge distribution.

36:25
And which, which I've chosen as capital R.

36:27
So you can see if you put small or capital R log one is zero and you get potential as zero.

36:31
So that is the original potential.

36:33
So I brought this example just to indicate to you that there may be situations where the potential may be turning to infinity at four of distances.

36:42
And so I may have to choose a different reference point for zero potential.

36:50
Now I want to bring in some very interesting aspects which is the eco potential surfaces.

37:09
Now we have earlier introduced the concept of electric field lines.

37:14
So we represent electric field distribution by electric field lines.

37:17
So these are lines of line curved lines in which which are such that the electric field at any point is the is directed along the tangent to, to that line.

37:27
And the closer the lines are, the stronger the electric field is the further they are less the electric field is we can similarly represent potential to what are called as eco potential surfaces.

37:39
So this is a graphical representation.

37:41
So what we do is we trust surfaces on which the potential remains constant.

37:48
So I take all those points for which the potential happens to be say V is equal to V one look at all the points and join them and get a surface.

37:55
Similarly, I take a surface corresponding to V is equal to V two, B is equal to be three and so on.

38:01
So I draw surfaces which are such that all points on that surface are at its constant potential.

38:08
So these are all three dimensional surfaces, unlike electric field lines, electric field lines are lines and these are complete surfaces.

38:16
So also notice that since it's an eco potential surface support eco potential surface happens to be like this.

38:23
So the potential on all these points are exactly the same.

38:26
So I would have to do no work in moving along the potential eco potential because the potential is the same.

38:33
So potential at this point and at this point are the same.

38:36
So I need not do any work in moving a charge from here to here.

38:41
So it implies that there can be no electric field component along the eco potential surface.

38:48
So electric field at every point must be perpendicular to eco potential surface.

38:53
Please look at this argument that if I had an eco potential surface, then all points on the surface have the same potential.

39:01
So the work done in moving a charge from one point of the surface to another point on the same surface must be zero because they are at the same potential and potential difference gives me the work done necessary to move a charge from one point to another point.

39:17
So because the because the potential is the same, that must mean no electric field along the directional motion, whatever direction I choose I move like this or like this or like this in any direction.

39:26
If I move on the surface, I would have to do no work in moving the charge, which means the electric field must be perpendicular like this.

39:33
So at this point, it must be like this.

39:35
If the surface is like this, it must be like this.

39:37
So electric field lines are always perpendicular to the potential eco potential surfaces.

39:42
And this is very, very important.

39:44
So eco potent surfaces and electric field lines form two are always perpendicular to each other.

39:52
So let me take an example of a point charge.

39:58
So suppose I take a point charge here is the point charge Q.

40:02
So remember for a point charge, the potential is Q by 45 eps island zero R.

40:10
So if you take, so R is the distance from the point charge.

40:15
So if you take points which are at the same distance from the point charge, they will have the same potential.

40:22
So for example, at R is equal to R one B must be B is equal to V, one is equal to Q by 45 sin and zero R one.

40:31
So if you take a distance R one from here, this this all points on the sphere are equal potentials.

40:38
Similarly, if you take R is equal to R two, V is equal to V two is equal to Q by four by epsilon zero R two.

40:48
That's another sphere, that's another sphere.

40:53
So equal potentials for a point charge are skes, I'm drawing a circle in a two dimensional space.

41:00
But you have to imagine the center thing is rotated around the point charge here.

41:04
So if I, if I rotate along any axis containing the point charge, I this circle will become spheres and all points on the sphere are at eco potential.

41:13
So for a sphere radius R one, the potential is V one is equal to Q by 4570 R one.

41:19
So this is an equal potential surface, that's a new potential surface.

41:22
And as you know, the electric field of a point charge is radial is like this.

41:27
And as you can see here, the electric field is always perpendicular to the potential surface.

41:36
So if the charge is positive, the arrows are pointing outwards, if the charge is negative, the errors are pointing inwards.

41:43
So I leave it to you to calculate whether in this case.

41:46
So R two is greater than R one.

41:49
What about if V two is greater than V one or is greater than we do?

42:01
So please think over it.

42:03
Which potential is larger is the potential here?

42:06
Larger than here or the potential here is smaller than here.

42:09
So I leave this problem to you to, to find, think about it to find out whether the potentials the potential surface with a larger radius is at a smaller potential or a higher potential.

42:19
If I have a charge, a positive charge here or a negative charge, for example, so that's equal potential for a point charge if I had uniform electric field lines.

42:38
So suppose I had electric field lines like this pointing in the direction a uniform electric field then eco potentials as you can see will be planes perpendicular to this line.

42:51
So if the electric field happens to be E equal to E zero K cap, so we call this a Z direction.

43:01
So the electric field lines are along the Z direction K cap direction.

43:04
So the equal potentials must be parallel to the xy plane.

43:07
So this is X why?

43:12
So eco potential are planes which are perpendicular Z axis here because the the electric field is along the Z axis.

43:22
So I have I can show you some figures here two figures which I will show you showing the potentials for a point charge.

43:28
And so this is this is equal potential for a point charge.

43:33
So they're all spheres and that is the center which is a positive, which is a charge.

43:38
This black dot is the charge.

43:39
And eco potential surfaces are all spheres surrounding the charge.

43:44
And as as I've drawn in the earlier case, the electric field is radial like this OK from the point charge, I also plotted eco potentials for a dipole.

44:03
This is calculated from the expression that we had written earlier, essentially this equation.

44:11
So you take different points, so you calculate those points for which this potential remains constant.

44:18
So as I move the point R one and R 2 may must vary such that one by R 11 and one by R two remains constant and I can draw.

44:24
So these are eco potential surfaces.

44:26
And as you can see here, the these are actual surfaces.

44:30
So I can imagine the surface by rotating about this axis, so the electric field lines will be perpendicular.

44:36
So for example, here, the electric field will be like this here, the electric field will be like this at this point.

44:41
The electric field will be like this.

44:44
The field here will be like this all everywhere is perpendicular.

44:48
It's like this.

44:52
So the the direction of electric field will depend on will be perpendicular to all the EENT surfaces.

44:59
So you can actually plot EENT surfaces for different charge distributions by calculating electric field by calculating the potential.

45:06
And from there, you can plot EENT surfaces and you can verify that electric field distribution is always at every point perpendicular to the surface.

45:19
Now a little while ago, I mentioned that electric field and the potential are related to each other.

45:26
So let's try to derive an expression relating electric field and potential.

45:44
So I want to consider consider two, I just sent ep potential surfaces.

46:04
So let me draw something like this.

46:06
So this is a potential V and there's another surface here V NOTT plus delta V, we not plus DV.

46:15
So these are two potentials which are very close to each other.

46:18
So we not and we not plus DV.

46:22
So as we know electric field at this point will be perpendicular, it will be like this, this will be a direction of electric field.

46:27
It has to be perpendicular to the tenant to this line.

46:30
So this must be like this perpendicular.

46:34
So now I want to do the following, I have a charge here, a unit charge which I move like this in some direction that we call it DL vector, I move a direction making an angle theta with the field direction.

46:50
So what is the work done by the external force and moving a unit charge from that we call this point A this point from find.

47:21
Yeah, the point is.

47:29
So remember these are equal potential surfaces here.

47:31
The potential is VV, not here.

47:33
The potential is V not plus DV.

47:35
So we done must be equal to B not plus DV.

47:39
The potential at B minus potential at A which is equal to DV.

47:46
Work done in moving a charge from A to B is potential at B minus potential at A which is B no plus DB minus B nought which is D.

47:53
Now, I also I also know how to calculate work done for electric fields.

47:57
So work done is also given by minus E dot DL.

48:12
Is there a track field?

48:14
So the force on the charge is E vector.

48:18
So I must apply a force which is opposite to the direction of electric vector which is minus E and I am moving a distance deal from here.

48:24
And what is Ed minus Edl which is nothing but minus Edl and these two must be equal.

48:36
So what I get an expression, A I see that Edl Costa it's called minus DV.

48:53
So I can write.

48:54
So DB is the difference in potential between these two points which is also given by minus EDL cost.

49:04
The so I get the following expression that E cost the is equal to minus lb by DEL L L is the DL is the element of length magnitude element of length.

49:18
And I'm moving DL vector is the length of the vector DL is the magnitude of the element of length.

49:23
And I'm moving in a direction defined by cost.

49:26
Theta theta is the angle between the electric vector and the direction DL.

49:31
So for example, if I so this is a general deal relationship, so let me assume I have a, a figure like this, I have an X axis here and a bi axis here.

49:39
So the equal potential happens to be like this.

49:41
So if I move from here to here a long parallel to the X axis.

49:44
So this is not, this is V no plus DV.

49:49
If I move parallel to the X axis, it works like this.

49:55
Then eco theta is not if this is theta E cost theta is nothing but X component of electric vector.

50:04
So my movement DL now is a long X axis of X success.

50:08
So DL will be a long XX access and the will be the angle between the vector and the X axis.

50:17
So E because the is nothing but the X component of electric field which is equal to minus del B by Dell, I'm writing partial derivative because the potential depends in general on all coordinates, XY and Z.

50:33
So the electric field component along the X axis is nothing but minus W by del X.

50:40
Similarly, if I move along the parallel to the bi axis, if I move like this, I can relate EY S minus del V by DEL Y and is that is minus by de three useful relationships which relate the potential to the electric field.

51:03
So you can see here the rate of change of potential with respect to X axis, with respect to X is the negative of the electric field component along X axis.

51:12
The rate of change of V with respect to Y with the negative of that is the electric field along the Y axis.

51:18
And del V by del Z is minus ez.

51:20
So the three electric field components are related to the potential variation as a function of XYZ.

51:27
So this is what I meant before.

51:29
If I calculate the potential distribution as a function of XYZ, I can from that expression, calculate the electric field distribution.

51:38
So in many situations, it is easy to calculate potential distribution because potential is a scalar quantity.

51:44
And when I integrate it's much easier to integrate a scalar quantity.

51:48
In the electric field case, I must calculate ex separately ey separately e separately because electric field is a better.

51:55
So let me show you an example of this calculation of electric relationship.

52:01
So, so potential for point charge.

52:17
So V of R we have already calculated is qy four pipes is zero R where is here and R is the distance.

52:28
So if in terms of coordinates, I can write that this is four pipes is and zero X square plus Y square plus Z square this per half but this point has coordinates XYZ and this is the origin.

52:45
So let me cal, let me write here X so this is XY and Z.

52:50
So you can the distance smaller the distance from the origin which is squared order of X capital Y square.

52:55
So for example, I can get ex is equal to minus del V by del X which is equal to minus Q by 45 silent zero in two, you can differentiate this XS square plus Y square plus Z square.

53:12
This for three by two, there'll be a minus half sign and there will be a sign of two X differential of X squared plus five square square is two X with the aspect of X partial derivative to the aspect of X.

53:25
And I get this equation which is equal to.

53:27
So two factor goes off and I get Q by four by epsilon zero.

53:33
So let me write like this X square plus Y square was that square into X by square root of X squared plus Y square plus square.

53:48
So this is nothing but two by four by epsilon zero R square.

53:54
And this is this is XYR.

54:03
Similarly, you can calculate EB and EZ and from there, I will show you that the total electric field is actually exactly what we had planned before.

54:11
Now, I want to close the lecture with a small problem.

54:21
An electric dipole of moment P is equal to stand is located at the origin in free space.

54:54
Calculate the potential at a point B with coordinates.

55:15
XP is equal to 0.5 m.

55:20
YP is equal to zero.

55:24
ZP is equal to point 8 7 m.

55:29
So I leave this problem to you.

55:30
Please calculate the potential at this point, please.

55:32
So you have a dipole loc located which is oriented along the Z axis here and you need to calculate what is the potential at this point.

55:39
Thank you very much.
video_07:
0:42
A very good morning to all of you.

0:45
We will continue with our discussion in the in electrostatics.

0:51
Lets recall in the last lecture we had discussed about capacitors and capacitance.

0:58
So capacitors are made up of two conductors separated by air or by an insulator and they carry equal and opposite charges.

1:09
So plus Q and minus Q and this particular device is called the capacitance capacitor.

1:16
And it's it stores charges and it actually stores electrostatic energy.

1:21
We had calculated the capacitance of a parallel plate capacitor, a cylindrical capacitor and a spherical capacitor.

1:31
So today, what I want to do is to calculate how much energy is stored in an in a capacitor.

1:39
So the topic today is electrostatic energy store in a cap.

2:03
So as before I have two conductors, one carrying charge plus Q, the other carrying charge minus Q equal and opposite charges.

2:15
There are electric field lines between these charges and the we start with two conductors which have no excess charge and we slowly move charges between the two conductors so that one of them gets positively charged, the other gets negatively charged.

2:33
So we are moving electrons from here into this conductor to leave a positive charge here and an excess negative charge here.

2:40
And we, this process is called charging the capacitor.

2:44
So the capacity is connected to a battery and that battery charges the capacitor.

2:49
So the question is when I charge the capacitor, how much energy is stored in the capacitor?

2:56
So to calculate this, let us follow the following procedure.

3:00
So suppose at the end we have a charge plus Q and minus Q and charge is Q and potential difference.

3:12
Me and we know that cap Q is equal to C times B we see the capacitance.

3:19
So now I start with a pair of conductors which have, which are neutral and no excess charge.

3:25
Now as I start to move charge electrons from this conductor to this conductor, I start doing work because the electrons are being pulled by the conductor here.

3:35
And I have to move the electrons in a away from its charge its force.

3:39
So by well for moving the electrons from here to here, I must do charge and that is the energy which is stored in the capacitor.

3:48
So let me assume that at some instant of time, the charge sq and the potential is given by V is equal to Q by C, we see the capacitance.

4:04
So at some instant of time, there is a charge plus small Q and minus small Q on the two conductors, they have a potential difference given by B is equal to two by C but C is the capacitance.

4:17
Now, at this point to further increase the charge, I move a small infinite decimal charge DQ from one capac one conductor to the other conductor.

4:28
So I move an infinite SML charge you.

4:40
And because the potential is we, the work done in moving charge you will be V times DQ which is equal to QDQ by C.

5:00
So I've replaced the potential difference between the 22 conductors by Q by C and I get this.

5:07
So I start with two conductors with zero charges and keep on moving charge from one to the other to finally charge the capacitor to A plus Q and A minus Q.

5:17
And so the total work done in charging from zero to capital Q will be W is equal to zero to Q Q by CD Q which is equal to one by C integral zero to Q QDQ which is nothing but Q squared by we see.

5:44
So the external agent has to do a work amounting to Q squared by two C in charging the capacitor.

5:51
And it is this work done that is stored as electrostatic energy within the capacitor.

5:56
So energy is stored is equal to U is equal to, to go back to C.

6:09
So this is while so while charging the capacitor, I am doing work.

6:13
And that work which I'm doing is told as electrostatic energy in the capacitor.

6:18
This formula is very similar to the energy potential energy stored in a spring mass system.

6:24
So if I have, if I have a mass connected a spring with spring constant K, remember that the energy stored in pulling the string by an extension X is half kx a square.

6:36
So the displacement plays the role of the charge here and case something like one by C in this equation.

6:43
So just like a pulled spring stores energy, a charge capacitor stores energy and that is the energy stored in the capacitor.

6:49
Now, using the relationship Q is equal to CB, I can write the energy stored in another form.

6:56
So Q squared by two C which is equal to one by two CQ is equal to CV.

7:02
So this is C squared B squared which is equal to half CB squared.

7:07
There's another form of electric energy.

7:10
I can also write it in a, in a different form.

7:13
I replace only one of the Q by C CV.

7:18
So which is equal to half QB.

7:21
So there are three forms of energy I can have energy is equal to Q squared by two C or energy is equal to half CV squared or energy equal to half QV.

7:37
All of them are equivalent and we can use any of them at any given time depending on the problem.

7:43
I will use one of these equations to calculate the energy stored.

7:49
No, I can actually calculate I can put this energy in a slightly different form by take the example of a parallel of great capacitor.

8:05
So remember in a parallel capacitor having an A dia and a separation D.

8:11
So put this is positive charge here and there's a negative charge here, there are electric field lines going downwards.

8:17
And so the energy stored is Q squared by two C or equal to half CB squared.

8:30
Now C is equal to epsilon zero A by D.

8:33
We have already calculated and B is equal to E times D.

8:40
So I can put U is equal to half epsilon zero A by D into E square into D square.

8:48
Easy trick field between the capacity plates.

8:52
And so this is equal to half epsilon zero E square into A times D.

9:00
So I write it in this form, separate the factors into two parts, half epsilon zero E square into one D cancels off and I get eight times D.

9:09
Now what is A times D?

9:11
This is volume and toast.

9:19
So if I look at this energy, I can interpret this equation by saying that the energy is stored in the form of an electrostatic field.

9:30
And the energy density or the energy per unit volume stored in the electrostatic field is given by half epsilon zero E square.

9:40
This is the volume of the capacitor.

9:43
And that is the, so if I multiply this quantity by the volume, I get the total energy, so this must be the energy per unit volume.

9:50
So if I have an electric field inside the, between the capacitor plates, I have an electric field.

9:54
E and I find that I can interpret this equation as if half epsilon zero E squared is the energy per unit volume stored in an electrostatic field.

10:06
Although I have derived this equation for a parallel pit capacitor, this is a very general equation.

10:11
And so if you have an electric field e at any point, the electrostatic energy that is contained in that electric field is half epsilon, epsilon zero E square if it is free space.

10:22
So that's energy density.

10:23
And this is a nice way of interpreting this electrostatic energy.

10:29
Now, although I have derived that for a parallel bit capacitor, I want to take an example another example and to show that this equation will also be working correctly.

10:40
So I take a spherical capacitor.

10:49
So remember I had a spherical capacitor, there was a conductor here and there was another conductor outside.

10:54
So R A is the radius of this conductor and RB is the radius of that conductor.

11:01
So let me draw charges here.

11:04
So I had plus charges here and I have minus charges in the.

11:18
So the conductor is a conductor.

11:24
So we have already calculated the capacitance of this capacity of the spherical capacitor is four pi epsilon zero RARB by RB minus R A.

11:41
In an earlier class, we had calculated the capacitance of a spherical capacitor as C is equal to four pipe silence zero RARB by RB minus R A.

11:51
So the energy stored U is equal to one by two Q squared by C which is equal to Q squared by eight by epsilon zero RARB, two RB minus R A.

12:15
So using the formula Q squared by two C I get an expression for the energy stored in a spherical capacitor as Q squared by eight by epsilon zero RB minus R A by rarb.

12:28
So that's one way of calculating.

12:30
Now let me calculate the energy stored in the electric field which lies between the two conductors and show you that if I assume the electrostatic energy density is as half epsilon zero E square, I will get the same expression for the total energy stored.

12:45
So let me redraw the capacity again.

12:47
So I have the inner conductor here and the outer conductor.

12:55
So in a conductor is positively charged.

12:58
So I have positive charges here and the ultra conductor has negative charges no.

13:14
So to calculate, so energy density I know is equal to half epsilon zero E square.

13:25
Now first, so for this to use this, I must calculate the electric field at different points.

13:30
So first thing remember that this is a conductor here, that's a conductor.

13:34
So the entire electric field in this configuration lies between the distance R A and RB.

13:43
There is no electric field within this conductor, there is no electric field within this conductor, there's no electric field anywhere else except in the region between R A and RB.

13:51
And to calculate this, I must know the electric field.

13:54
So what we have done before is exactly like this.

13:57
So I take a Gaussian surface of radius R and calculate the flux crossing this.

14:03
So flux crossing is four by R squared into E which because E is the radial and so the flux crossing, the spherical surface is four pi R squared to E which is equal to charge and close by epsilon zero.

14:16
So E is equal to Q by four by epsilon zero R square.

14:23
So we have seen this before.

14:25
This particular spherical charge distribution actually is equivalent to a point charge situated at the center of the sphere.

14:32
That's the electric field.

14:33
And please now note that the electric field depends on the position in a planar in a parallel plate capacitor directory field was uniform here.

14:42
The directory field depends on position.

14:43
So I just cannot multiply this number by the volume I must integrate.

14:48
So what I do is I take, so this is my inner conductor here.

14:52
So I take a surface lying between R a volume line between R and R plus Dr.

14:59
So this is R plus Dr.

15:03
So in this volume, I want to calculate the energy and then I will integrate over the entire distance from R eight RB.

15:09
So what is the energy contained in the volume between R and R plus Dr the energy density epsilon zero E square, which is Q squared by four pi epsilon zero hold square RS per four E square into the volume of this which is four pi R squared into Dr the area of the sphere into the thickness which is four pr square.

15:33
Dr So this gives me equal to Q square by number 14570 cancels off and I get 85590 into Dr by R square.

15:49
So one R square cancels off and I get eight Q squared by 8570, Dr by R square.

15:54
So as you can see the energy stored changes with position because the electric field is strong here.

15:59
So there is more energy density, the electric field is weaker, gets weaker as you go away from the center and the energy density keeps on decreasing.

16:06
So that's energy density energy lying between R and R plus Dr.

16:10
So the total energy total stored energy U is equal to integral R A to RB, Q squared by eight by epsilon zero Dr by R square, which is equal to two squared by eight pipes is zero in two, one by R A minus one by RB which is equal to Q squared into RB minus R A 585 epsilon zero RARB.

16:54
And if you compare this with the expression that we had just now obtained from the other equation, you see this equation here, they are the same equation Q squared by 85 R zero into RB minus R A by rarb.

17:07
So please note that either of the formulations gives me the same total energy contained.

17:13
In this case, I had to be a little careful because the electric wheel is not uniform.

17:18
So the energy density stored in the electric field, electric wheel changes the position.

17:23
So when I calculate, in such a case, I must calculate the electric field at different points and then I will get the energy density at different points.

17:32
And then I have to integrate over the entire volume where the elect elect static field exists.

17:38
So these are two ways of calculating.

17:40
And this tells me that energy is stored in the in a, in an electrostatic field.

17:46
And so when a capacitor is charged I store electrostatic energy and that energy can be discharged at any later time from the capacitor.

17:55
And so the capacitor does work and releases the energy.

18:01
Now, I want to discuss something about dielectrics and polarization.

18:17
Remember we had discussed dielectrics are those materials in which there are no free electrons.

18:23
So the unlike conductors in conductors, there are free electrons, the outermost electrons of the atoms are free from the atom and they are free to move anywhere within the conductor.

18:34
So when you put a conductor in an electric field, the electric field, then a a applies the force on these charges on these electrons which then move because of the electric field and they continue to move until the electric field within the conductor becomes zero.

18:48
So if you have seen that in the static case, there cannot be any electric field within the conductor.

18:54
Now, in a dielectric, there are no free electrons but there are atoms which contain charges.

19:00
So usually as we have discussed before, the center of the negative charge of the electron cloud surrounding the nucleus and the center of the positive charge of the nucleus are coincident at the same point.

19:13
So you don't see any electric field from the atom.

19:16
But when you put an atom in an electric field, the atom gets polarized.

19:20
So what happens is you may start with an atom with a positive and negative charge which are coincident at the center.

19:26
So when you apply an electric field like this, then what happens is you have a small separation of negative and positive charges and just found the diaper we have seen this is a diaper and it's characterized by dial moment.

19:44
So when you place a dielectric within an electric field, the atoms get polarized.

19:49
And the we say that the dielectric gets polarized in this process.

19:54
So we will call such a director to be a polarized electric.

19:59
So placing a dielectric within an electric field immediately polarizes the dielectric.

20:03
So now first, let me see what happens if I had a uniform electric field and I had a block of conductor.

20:09
So I had a conducting block here and I had an electric field in this direction, a uniform electric field, for example, I place this conductor between the plates of a parallel capacitor.

20:20
So I have this conductor.

20:22
Now at the moment, I apply an electric field on the conductor inside the conductor.

20:27
There is instantaneously some electric field that electric field now will move the char electrons and the electrons will get accumulated on one side leaving a net positive charge on the other side.

20:39
So you have electrons attracted here to this side and there will be net positive charge on the other side of the conductor, we have seen this before.

20:49
So this leaves a surface charge density on the conductor and the charges will continue to move until the net electric field within the conductor becomes zero.

20:59
So if the electric field which I've applied is eno and if Sigma is the surface charge density here, the electric field because of these two surface charge density is sigma by epsilon zero and that must be equal to E not so e not is like this.

21:17
And the electric field because of the the surface charge, this is like this and they must be equal to cancel the electric field here.

21:24
So I generate a surface charge and c which is epsilon zero is zero.

21:29
So this surface charge density creates gets created which creates its own electric field.

21:34
So the electric field within the conductor becomes zero.

21:36
That is the story of a conductor.

21:38
Now, what happens if I place a dielectric inside an electric field?

21:45
So let me take a dielectric.

21:46
Now, so I have a dielectric and I again have a uniform electric field applied in this upper direction.

21:59
No, as we have seen in the absence of an electric field, there are atoms within the dielectric whose positive and negative charges coincide.

22:08
The moment an electric field is applied, the negative charges get attracted and I will schematically draw each of these atoms as a over object here.

22:21
This is essentially denoting each of the dipoles which is formed because of the application of the electric field.

22:30
And I know that the charges will be plus on the upper side and minus on the lower side.

22:40
So the electrons get attracted in the downward direction because of the electric field leaving a net positive charge.

22:48
So there are each atom becomes a dipole with the drip pointing upwards.

22:54
So remember the dipole moment of a dipole is a vector joining the minus to the plus charge.

23:01
So these are all dipoles, most small dipoles which have the dile moments pointing upwards.

23:08
Now, so I've just drawn some atoms, there are billions and billions of atoms in the in the dielectric.

23:13
So this dielectric gets polarized.

23:15
This is supposed to be a polarized dielectric.

23:17
Now, you can see if you take any small volume within the dielectric volume is small compared to the size of the dielectric.

23:26
This the the measure the transfer size of the dialect but small large compared to the atomic spacing, you can see that there will be an equal number of positive and negative charges within that volume.

23:38
So effectively, there is no volume charge density created within the electric within the dielectric.

23:43
But look at the surface at the surface.

23:45
Here, there are negative charges left which are not compensated by positive charges.

23:50
Similarly, there are positive charges left on the upper surface which are not compensated by the negative charges.

23:57
So the moment I put a dielectric in an electric field, the atoms get polarized, each atom becomes a small diaper moment.

24:08
And you are left with a surface charge density on the lower side, negative surface charge density on this side and a positive surface charge density on this side.

24:16
So the result of polarizing a dielectric is to leave surface charge density on both surfaces.

24:22
In this, in this diagram, this particular surface and this particular surface.

24:28
So this dipole now will create its own electric field.

24:31
So there are charges negative charges on the lower surface positive charges, net charges on the upper surface that produces a downward looking electric field which partially cancels this electric field in a conductor.

24:43
The downward directed electric field is equal to the upward directed applied electric field resulting in a complete cancellation in the dielectric case.

24:52
As you will see, the cancellation is partial So let me assume that in the dielectric, I'm left with a, a positive charge, a positive charge on the upper surface.

25:04
So the upper surface has a net positive charge and the lower surface has a ne negative charge and there is no other volume charge density inside.

25:16
So I have an e uniform electric wheel.

25:24
So this results in what I would call as bound surface charge density.

25:28
So Sigma P and minus Sigma B.

25:31
Sigma B is the boned start this charge density.

25:49
It is called bound surface charge density because these electrons are not freed from the atom.

25:55
They are still attached to the atom.

25:57
Only thing that has happened is they have got a little stretched.

26:00
The center of the negative charge has got displaced with the respirator center of the positive charge.

26:05
With the result that is each atom becomes a dipole.

26:07
And when this dial gets polarized, I'm it results in a bound charge density on these two surfaces.

26:15
And we see that the dielectric is polarized.

26:22
And to quantify this, this this polarization, we define a vector called polarization, which is denoted by P, this is the diaper moment per unit volume.

26:52
So you take a small unit volume or you take a small volume, delta V, calculate the total dipole moment of delta V and divide the dipole moment by the delta V to get the polarization of the, of the dielectric.

27:04
And this polarization is caused by the external electric field.

27:09
So inside the dial, there is an electric field E and there is also polarization P.

27:14
So this polarization vector must be proportional to the electric field applied.

27:19
And so we have a relationship like this epsilon zero ke this is epsilon zero is the per permittivity of free space.

27:28
And K is called the electric susceptibility.

27:41
It measures how much susceptible is the dialectic to polarization.

27:46
So that's a susceptibility.

27:47
So P is called the polarization and it's related it's proportional to the electric field.

27:53
Now, this relation is true for small electric fields.

27:56
And if your electric fields become very strong, then this equation breaks down and we need to modify this equation.

28:02
But we will not discuss that here for small electric fields which are usually found polarization of the dielectric is proportional to the electric field.

28:09
And as this vector relationship shows that P and E are in the same direction.

28:15
No.

28:16
So let me calculate.

28:19
So how do I relate polarization to the surface charge density?

28:22
So we have, we have shown that there is a bone surface charge density and this bone surface charge density comes because of polarization.

28:29
So how is this speed related to the surface charge density?

28:33
So to calculate this, what I do is the following, I take a cylinder, a small cylinder of length L area A and poll rice like this.

28:51
So let me assume that the two ends of the cylinder are at right angles to the polarization.

28:56
The polarization is along the length of the cylinder and the polarization in the dielectric you go to P.

29:07
So let me add a scalar relationship my no along this direction.

29:09
So the polarization is P and volume is A times L.

29:16
So the dipole moment of this cylinder is P times A times L P is the dipole moment per unit volume.

29:31
A times L is the volume of the dielectric A surface area multiplied by the length and P times eight times L is the dipole moment of this cylinder.

29:41
Now I can also write this R movement in a slightly different form.

29:44
Let me assume the charges are Q minus Q and plus Q here.

29:51
So if I have two charges plus two and minus two separated by length, L I can write the dipole moment two times L.

30:04
So this implies that Q times L is equal to P times A times L or Q is equal to P times A.

30:16
So Q is the charge accumulated on this side plus Q minus Q and the surface area is A.

30:22
So I can define I can get the bound surface charge density sigma B is equal to Q by A which is equal to P.

30:43
So when I have this, when I look at the cylindrical object which is polarized along the axis of the cylinder, I find that the surface charge density here, bone surface charge density on both sides are is minus sigma B and plus sigma B.

30:57
So the surface bone surface charge density is related to polarization like this.

31:02
And in this example, I have assumed that the surface and surface is perpendicular to the polarization vector.

31:10
Now, you may not have always the same situation, you may have surfaces which are not perpendicular to the polarization to find out what happens in a situation like this.

31:18
So let me draw the same cylinder here.

31:20
Now, now the surface happens to be at an angle.

31:23
So let me assume that this angle is theta, the dish is still like this.

31:29
Theta is this angle, theta is the angle made by made between this inclined surface inclined area and this normal.

31:38
So I can define as we have defined before a unit normal along the area and polarization batteries like this.

31:44
And this is the, now please remember just like before the charges which are accumulating here is minus Q and on the surface is also plus Q, the same charge that gets accumulated on the other surface.

32:03
No, the area instead of being A is a by this area is larger than this area, this area is perpendicular area, that's an inclined area.

32:14
So if a, if an inclined area, that area is larger than this area A and it's a by so the bound charge you den C now becomes sigma B is equal to Q by A by cost which is equal to B the because Q by A is sigma is P into which is equal to P dot N P vector is like this N vector is the normal to the surface is output normal the surface, the volume of the, of the dialect is here N cap is the outward normal and P costs is nothing but P dot N.

33:05
So this is a specialized relation when P and N are parallel.

33:08
But in general, if you have a surface in which, which is on the one side of which the dial with the polarization P, it creates a surface charge density bound surface charge density of P dot N.

33:21
So you can see in this example on the, on the left side, this side and batteries like this and cap and P vector on this is like this.

33:30
So P dot N is minus.

33:32
So you have a minus minus charge density here on the surface cynical is a surface and cap is like this P is like this and P dot N is zero.

33:42
So there are no surface charge densities on the S surface because that is parallel to the P vector and the normal to the surface is perpend to P vector and P dot and become zero on the surface which is inclined at an angle.

33:55
Theta the surface bone surface charge density is P dot N which is Sigma B.

34:00
So that's a very general relationship whenever you have a polarization P in a dielectric the it creates a bone surface charge density of P dot M.

34:10
So this this relationship is useful for us to analyze dialects electrostatics and with dila.

34:18
So now I want to calculate the capacitor with the capacitor with a dielectric.

34:34
In all of our earlier discussions, we assumed that the capacitor plates are have no, they have just space and there is air or vacuum in between.

34:42
We don't consider any medium to be present within the plates of the capacitor.

34:46
Now, I want to have a capacitor in which I am going to assume that there is a dielectric kept filling the entire space.

34:54
So I have a dielectric here within an entire space of the between the panel with capac.

35:01
So again, let me draw positive charges here and there will be negative charges on the plate here.

35:12
So there is an energy field in the downward direction.

35:16
So this will result in a negative accumulation of negative bound charge here and an accumulation of positive bond charge here.

35:27
So let me right here.

35:29
So this is plus sigma F, this is minus sigma F.

35:35
This is minus sigma B and this is plus movie on the surface of the dielectric, we have bone surface charging densities which I'm calling minus sigma B and plus Sigma B.

35:48
On the surface of the conductors, we have three charges which are plastic M and minus sigma F.

35:54
Now, I want to calculate what is the electric field within the dielectric.

36:00
So we follow the same procedure as before we use Gauss's law.

36:04
So I take a Gaussian surface like this, I take a Gaussian cylindrical surface, an area a and in the vertical direction.

36:14
Now you can see here because of the symmetry of the problem, the electric field will be downwards.

36:23
There is an electric field created by the chargers plus and minus on the conducting plates which is acting downwards.

36:29
There is a electric field created by the dielectric polarized dielectric which is upwards.

36:34
But as we have seen before this, you will see that this cancellation is not perfect.

36:39
So there is some, some electric fields still left within the within the dielectric.

36:42
Unlike a conductor where the electric field should be zero, there is no such condition for dielectrics.

36:48
So the electric field lines are like this.

36:50
So this is the Gaussian surface, there is no electric field within the conductor.

36:54
So the flux on the surface is zero.

36:56
This cylindrical surface of the con of the Gaussian surface is parallel to the electric field.

37:00
So there is no flux on that there is only a flux from here.

37:03
So if E to field into a which is the flux must be equal to the charge and closed.

37:10
Now the charge enclosed has two components, three charges here and bound charges here.

37:15
So the total charge is Sigma F minus Sigma B into area because that is the surface surface charge density and see the surface charge density multiplied by a of the charge divided by epsilon.

37:29
So that's law, the electric flux through any closed surface is equal to charge and close to by epsilon zero.

37:35
And that's what I'm using here.

37:37
So a cancels out when I get epsilon zero A is equal to epsilon zero E is equal to sigma F minus Sigma B.

37:46
Now Sigma B, we have just now shown Sigma B in this case will be P which is equal to epsilon zero ke.

37:56
So I have epsilon zero E plus Sigma B which is epsilon zero ke is equal to Sigma F.

38:04
So this implies epsilon zero into one plus K into E is equal to Sigma F.

38:15
So guys are susceptibility.

38:17
So we define new quantities.

38:19
Now I define a dielectric constant KS one plus K and then I have permittivity of the dielectric.

38:45
Epsilon is equal to epsilon zero into one plus K which is equal to epsilon zero and two K epsilon zero is the permittivity of free space.

38:56
Epsilon is the permittivity of the medium of the dielectric.

38:59
And so epsilon is equal to epsilon zero times K and K is usually greater than equal to one K is equal to one for free space or vacuum and K is always more than one.

39:10
So if I go back to this equation, I get the electric field in the dielectric as E is equal to sigma F by epsilon zero K, which is equal to sigma F by epsilon.

39:25
And you can see here that because K is more than one, this electric field is smaller than the electric field when there was no dielectric place within the plates of the conductor between the plates.

39:37
So the electric field within the dielectric actually smaller than the electric field which was created in free space.

39:44
And this, the reduction is by a factor K which is the director of the dielectric.

39:51
So let me take an example here.

39:53
So before that, I'll give you some values of constants of standard materials which are used in various capacitors.

40:04
So I have a table here and K so X glass, it's a type of gas 4.7 poly which is 2.6 paper is 3.5 porcelain, which is 6.5 Titania ceramic, 1 30.

40:48
So there are dielectrics with very strong permit strontium, tighten it, which is even larger 310.

41:01
And it's interesting to know the dietary constant of water, which is 80.4.

41:08
So these are some diary constraints of some dielectrics which are used either in capacitors or otherwise we would, we should know some of the numbers.

41:17
And we can see here, there's a wide variety of dielectrics with dietary constrains varying, arrived from almost close to one, in fact, at the consonant which is very, very close to one, slightly more than one, very close to one right up to a couple of 100.

41:30
So it's a very wide range of materials.

41:32
And depending on the kind of capacity I need, I can use different dials for, for the capacitance.

41:39
So let me take an example here.

41:47
OK.

41:47
So we have calculated this electric field has equal to sigma epsilon.

41:52
So let me go back and look at what is the capacity of this capacity.

41:57
So I have the electric filling the space between the.

42:01
So electric field becomes Sigma F by epsilon.

42:05
Now Sigma F is equal to Q by A A is the area of the plates and E is equal to potential difference divided by the separation.

42:23
So B by D is equal to two by A epsilon.

42:29
This implies V is equal to Q into D by a silence.

42:37
So we, we know the capacitance is given by Q is equal to CV Q is equal to C times V.

42:45
So the capacitance of this capacity with the dielectric filling C is equal to.

42:57
So C is Q by B which is silent.

43:00
A remember when the space between the parallel plates was filled with free space, the capacitance was epsilon zero A by D.

43:12
Now the capacitance is epsilon A by D which is actually epsilon zero kayd because epsilon, the permittivity of the dielectric is epsilon zero times the dielectric constant.

43:23
So the capacitance has increased by a factor K.

43:27
So as an example, let me take so here's an example.

43:32
So area of plates, 100 centimeter square and spacing between the plates is one centimeter Soviet air, first, air separating the plates, epsilon is equal to epsilon zero approximately.

43:59
And you can calculate the capacity C A is equal to epsilon zero A by D which comes out to be 8.85.

44:10
If you put a dielectric and consent is 2.6 then the capacity with the dielectric becomes about 23.01.

44:30
So there's an increase in capacitance by the factor the electric constant.

44:34
OK.

44:34
And the capacitance increases by filling the capac capacity with dielectrics.

44:39
So actually, if you want to have a higher capacitance, we can use dielectrics to fill and increase the capacitance.

44:47
Let me try to clarify further here.

44:50
So let me take for example, the same capacitor but instead of filling the entire space with the dielectric, suppose I had dielectric only partially filling and I had posy charges here, negative charges on the lower plate of the conductor.

45:08
So see that these are the two conducting plates.

45:10
So this induces a negative bone charge here and that induces a sorry positive bone charge here and negative bone charge on this side.

45:22
So you have an electric field pointing downward here, finally downward here and also pointing downward here but slightly weaker.

45:36
So you can actually calculate the electric field in this in this space E A.

45:42
So if, if I call this sigma F and this is Sigma B E A is equal to Sigma F by epsilon zero.

45:53
And if the diary of this is K, the Sigma dialect E dialect is equal to Sigma F by epsilon zero times K which is equal to sigma F by epsilon.

46:09
And you can see that E A is ne of the dielectric.

46:16
So what the director does is gets polarized, a polarized dielectric creates an electric field in the opposite direction as the applied electric field.

46:26
And there is a partial cancellation in a conductor.

46:29
This cancellation is complete while in a dielectric, the cancellation is only partial.

46:36
OK.

46:37
So we can look at various examples.

46:39
But before I do that, I would like to discuss a very important issue which is Gauss's law in dielectrics.

46:59
Still.

46:59
Now, we have discussed Gauss's Law with no medium in between.

47:04
So we had a, a charge surface charge density, for example, or a conductor which is charged or a point charge set of point charges all in free space.

47:13
And we never took any account of any medium.

47:15
Now, I want to find out what happens to Gauss's law in the presence of a dielectric.

47:20
So to understand what happens if we consider the following situation, I have this, this is the conductor and this is a dialect is a conductor and this is a dielectric.

47:37
So let me assume there are positive charges on the on the surface of the conductor.

47:45
This will lead to a bound surface charge density on the surface of the conductor.

47:52
So this is Sigma F and this is Sigma b free free charges on the surface of the conductor here and bound charges on the surface of the dielectric.

48:06
So let me take a Gaussian surface like this.

48:13
And assuming this to be flat plate plain surfaces, the electric field lines are perpendicular to this interface.

48:21
There is no electric field on the on the surface because it is inside the conductor, there is no electric field crossing these surfaces because electric field lines are parallel to this curve surface, the only electric field crossing is on the surface.

48:35
So if the surface area is A, I will write E times A is equal to just like before sigma F minus Sigma B.

48:44
The net charge multiplied by A by sin and zero.

48:48
So electric field crossing this entire surface Gaussian surface is E times A because there is no electric field here, this line there is no crossing, there is no flux on the surface.

48:58
The only flux is from the surface within the dielectric.

49:01
So I will write this as epsilon zero E plus Sigma B is equal to Sigma F and Sigma B I know is nothing but P.

49:12
So I write this as epsilon zero E plus P is equal to sigma F.

49:18
Now there is a name given to this vector.

49:20
It's called the displacement vector D vector is equal to epsilon zero E plus P.

49:39
So this is scalar relationship.

49:40
But if I look at it a vector form, this is a displacement vector.

49:44
So this equation becomes nothing but D is equal to sigma.

49:51
Now, I can multiply both sides by area and write this as a.

49:59
Now what is I can interpret D times A as the flux of the displacement vector through the same Gaussian surface.

50:08
What this was the flux of the electric field through the Gaussian surface D times A I can interpret as the flux of the displacement vector on the same Gaussian surface.

50:18
So I get that the flux of the displacement vector is equal to total free charge enclosed by the surface.

50:29
This was free charge, the total charge including free inbound charges.

50:33
Here I get displacement flux of displacement vector is equal to the free charge and closed.

50:38
So I get I get this equation, I can write this in an integral form as the following integral D dot D A is equal to free charge and lost the Gaussian.

50:56
The Gauss law for electric fields was integral E dot E A is equal to total charge enclosed by epsilon zero.

51:02
Here for the displacement vector.

51:04
This is the Gauss law.

51:06
I can also write this as epsilon E dot D A S two.

51:12
We are close.

51:13
Please remember that on this in this equation in this Gauss's law form, the charge on the right hand side is only the free charge.

51:23
And that is all that I needed to know to find out what is the displacement vector.

51:28
And from the displacement vector, I can use this equation to calculate the electric field vetter.

51:35
Now let me take one example of Gauss's law, a dielectric.

51:42
So let me assume that I have a conductor of radius a surrounded by a dielectric of radius B.

51:52
This is a conductor.

51:54
And let me assume that the charge the charge Q on this Q and this is the dielectrics.

52:04
Now, because of this spherical symmetry, the electric field lines will be radial, the replacement vector lines will be radial.

52:12
So I take a Gaussian surface of radius R.

52:18
So I use this equation D dot D A is equal to three charge and closed because the displacement vector is perpendicular to the surface.

52:31
This does be simply D times four PI R square is equal to QQ is the surface charge enclosed, the charge enclosed.

52:39
Please remember there's a dial here.

52:41
So if I were to draw the charges, if the dial has positive charge, there will be negative bound charges on the side.

52:49
But I'm not bothered about the bond charges at all in using this form of Gauss's law because it only requires knowledge of free charges.

52:56
So displacement vector is actually two by four by R square.

53:00
In fact, no matter what value are you take, whether within the dielectric or outside the dielectric, there is a displacement vector.

53:06
So for R less than B greater than A, but less than B, the displacement is equal to Q by four pi R square.

53:18
And this is called epsilon, E because that's a dial with permit epsilon.

53:23
So E will be equal to Q by four by epsilon square.

53:29
Four are greater than A for, for R greater than B.

53:35
This is again given by Q by four pi R square.

53:40
But now, in this case, D is epsilon zero E.

53:43
So the electric field in this case will be Q by four by epsilon zero R square.

53:50
So you see what I've got is using this form of Gauss's law.

53:55
I have been able to calculate what is the electric field in a situation like this.

53:59
So once I know the electric field in all the regions, I can use this electric field in the expression for polarization to calculate the polarization.

54:06
Once I know the polarization, I can calculate the stuff for judgment.

54:10
So this is a very, very powerful form of Gauss's law with using electric, with using displacement vector and is applicable whether you have di electrics or not.

54:19
And this is very useful especially in situations where there is symmetry.

54:24
So I would like to summarize what we have been doing in electrostatics.

54:28
We started with Kums Law.

54:31
Then we introduced the principle of superposition where we calculated the total electric field by a number of charges.

54:38
And then with that, we also introduced the concept of electric field lines.

54:45
And then we specifically calculated the electric field to Q to dipole and also calculated what are the forces and talks on diles.

54:53
And then we introduced the very important principle of Gauss's law and used the Gauss law to calculate electric fields in different symmetric situations.

55:01
We introduced the concept of Gauss of flux, electric flux.

55:05
And then we also discussed capac conductors e equipotent surfaces, electrostatic potential energy and electrostatic potential.

55:14
And finally, we discussed some capacitors and capacity and also electric insert capacitors and how the electric fields get modified.

55:21
And finally, we just introduced Gauss's law in a dielectric and these are very general principles of great application in the field of electromagnetic.

55:30
Thank you very much.
